# LAN (Local Area Network)

* Star Topology
  * Every packet is sent through this switch, which means if the switch goes down the network will no longer work
* Bus Topology
  * With a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single cable, often called the backbone
  * A major flaw in the bus topology is that it can't handle a large amount of data
  * One of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up because of their expenses, such as cabling or dedicated networking equipment used to connect these devices.
* Ring Topology
  * One of the major flaws with a ring topology is that if a device goes down or a cable is broken, then data will no longer be passed
