# TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**three-way handshake** When you attempt to make a connection, your computer first sends a special request to the remote server indicating that it wants to initialise a connection. This request contains something called a SYN (short for synchronise) bit, which essentially makes first contact in starting the connection process. The server will then respond with a packet containing the SYN bit, as well as another "acknowledgement" bit, called ACK. Finally, your computer will send a packet that contains the ACK bit by itself, confirming that the connection has been setup successfully.

The first thing that your computer does is check its local cache to see if it's already got an IP address stored for the website. Assuming the address hasn't already been found, your computer will then send a request to what's known as a recursive DNS server. These will automatically be known to the router on your network.

Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers are split up into extensions. So, for example, if you were searching for tryhackme.com your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handled .com domains.

Computer have 65535 ports and 1024 are well known.

When is port closed TCP send RST flag (reset).

When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable.

NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used because of firewall evasion.

### Establishing Sequence Numbers

* Each TCP connection requires two sets of sequence numbers
  * One sequence number for messages from the client to the server
  * One sequence number for messages from the server to the client
* Before starting a TCP connection, the client and server must agree on two **initial sequence numbers (ISNs)**
  * The ISNs are different and random for every connection

#### Sending and Receiving Data

The first byte is byte i = 1, since sequence number x was used for the SYN packet and y for the SYN-ACK packet

#### Retransmission

* If a packet is dropped (lost in transit):
  * The recipient will not send an ACK, so the sender will not receive the ACK
  * The sender repeatedly tries to send the packet again until it receives the ACK
* If a packet is received, but the ACK is dropped:
  * The sender tries to send the packet again since it didn’t receive the ACK
  * The recipient ignores the duplicate data and sends the ACK again

#### Ending/Aborting a Connection

* To end a connection, one side sends a packet with the FIN (finish) flag set, which should then be acknowledged
  * This means “I will no longer be sending any more packets, but I will continue to receive packets”
  * Once the other side is no longer sending packets, it sends a packet with the FIN flag set
* To abort a connection, one side sends a packet with the RST (reset) flag set
  * This means “I will no longer be sending nor receiving packets on this connection”
  * RST packets are not acknowledged since they usually mean that something went wrong

### TCP Flags

**ACK**

* Indicator that the user is acknowledging the receipt of something (in the ack number)
* Pretty much always set except the very first packet **SYN**
* Indicator of the beginning of the connection **FIN**
* One way to end the connection
* Requires an acknowledgement
* No longer sending packets, but will continue to receive **RST**
* One way to end a connection
* Does not require an acknowledgement
* No longer sending or receiving packets
