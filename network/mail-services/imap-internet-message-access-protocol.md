* IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients).
* Default **port 143**.

```bash

* IMAP requires each command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply.
* So we added `c1`, then `c2`, and so on.
* Listed our mail folders using `LIST "" "*"`
* Before checking if we have any new messages in the inbox using `EXAMINE INBOX.`
