# WIFI

* SSID: The network "name" that you see when you try and connect
* ESSID: An SSID that \*may\* apply to multiple access points, eg a company office, normally forming a bigger network. For Aircrack they normally refer to the network you're attacking.
* BSSID: An access point MAC (hardware) address
* WPA2-PSK: Wifi networks that you connect to by providing a password that's the same for everyone
* WPA2-EAP: Wifi networks that you authenticate to by providing a username and password, which is sent to a RADIUS server.
* RADIUS: A server for authenticating clients, not just for wifi.
