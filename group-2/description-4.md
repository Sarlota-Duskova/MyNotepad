# Description

* **5.1 Explain the network troubleshooting methodology.**
  * Identify the problem
    * Gather information
    * Question users
    * Identify symptoms
    * Determine if anything has changed
    * Duplicate the problem, if possible
    * Approach multiple problems individually
  * Establish a theory of probable cause
    * Question the obvious
    * Consider multiple approaches
      * Top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top OSI model
      * Divide and conquer
  * Test the theory to determine the cause
    * If the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem
    * If the theory is not confirmed, reestablish a new theory or escalate
  * Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
  * Implement the solution or escalate as necessary
  * Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
  * Document findings, actions, outcomes, and lessons learned
