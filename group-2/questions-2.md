# Questions

1.  After starting work as the network administrator of Wingtip Toys, you discover that all of the switches in the company's datacenter have support for remote management, with built-in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agents in each port. Which of the following tasks must you perform to be able to gather information from the agents on those switches and display it on a central console? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Install the network management software on a network computer.
    2. Install a Management Information Base (MIB) on each of the switches.
    3. Install an agent on the console computer.
    4. Install an MIB on the console computer.
    5. Purchase a network management product.

    Answer:

    A, E. An SNMP-based network management system consists of three components: a management console software product installed on a network computer, agents installed on the devices you want to manage, and MIBs for each of the agents. Because the switches support SNMP management and already have agents, they have MIBs also. Therefore, all you have to do is purchase the network management software and install the console on a network computer.
2.  Which versions of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) do not include any security protection other than a cleartext community string? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. SNMPv1
    2. SNMPv2
    3. SNMPv2c
    4. SNMPv3

    Answer:

    A, C. SNMP version 1, the original version, used an unencrypted community string. SNMPv2 added better security, but it was not backward compatible with the version 1 community string. A revised version, SNMP2c, added backward compatibility. SNMPv3, the one most often seen today, includes more advanced security and does not use a community string.
3.  Which of the following statements about the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) are not true? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. To effectively monitor a network using SNMP, you must be sure that all of the equipment you purchase when designing and building your network supports the protocol.
    2. SNMP is not only the name of a protocol, it is also the name of a network management product.
    3. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 rely on a community string as their only means of security.
    4. Most of the network management products on the market today support SNMPv3.

    Answer:

    B, C. SNMP is not the name of a network management product; it is just the name of the protocol that provides a framework for the interaction of the various components in a network management product. SNMPv1 uses a community string, but SNMPv2 does not. The interim version SNMPv2c retains the community string from version 1 in place of the new version 2 security system. When you see a network interface adapter, switch, router, access point, or other device that purports to be managed or that claims to have network management capabilities, this usually means that the device includes an SNMP agent. Most of today's network management products do support SNMPv3. In addition, many network management products that implement SNMPv3 also include support for the earlier, unprotected versions, such as SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.

    4. Log Viewer

    Answer:

    C. The utility shown in the figure is the Windows Event Viewer, which displays the contents of the system, application, setup, and security logs, as well as others.
5.  Which of the following was created to provide logging services for the Unix sendmail program?

    1. Syslog
    2. Netstat
    3. SNMP
    4. CARP

    Answer:

    A. Syslog is a standard designed to facilitate the transmission of log entries generated by a device or process, such as the sendmail Simple Network Management Protocol (SMTP) server, across an Internet Protocol (IP) network to a message collector, called a syslog server. Netstat is a program that displays status information about a system's network connections; it does not provide logging services. SNMP is a protocol that carries network management information from agents to a central console; it was not created specifically for sendmail. The Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) enables proxy servers to exchange information; it does not provide logging services.
6.  You are the network administrator of your company's network. Your company wants to perform a baseline analysis of network-related traffic and statistics. They want to track broadcasts, Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) errors, and collisions for all traffic traversing a switched network. In addition, they want to provide historical and daily reports for management. They also want to keep track of software distribution and metering. What type of network software product best meets these needs?

    1. SNMP management
    2. Protocol analyzer
    3. Performance Monitor
    4. Network traffic monitor

    Answer:

    A. The best solution is to implement Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This includes a management console, agents, and Management Information Bases (MIBs). SNMP allows you to track statistical network information (historical and current) and produce reports for baseline analysis and troubleshooting. Some SNMP products also allow you to track software distribution and metering. Protocol analyzers are best used for troubleshooting problems in real time and are not used for software distribution and metering. Performance Monitor is a tool that allows you to track performance statistics for one system at a time and does not include software distribution and metering. There is no such product as a network traffic monitor.
7.  Which of the following technologies provides both real-time monitoring of security events and automated analysis of the event information gathered?

    1. SIEM
    2. SNMP
    3. SEM
    4. SIM

    Answer:

    A. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a product that combines two technologies: security event management (SEM) and security information management (SIM). Together, the two provide a combined solution for gathering and analyzing information about a network's security events. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a technology that gathers information about managed devices.
8.  SIEM products combine the capabilities of which of the following? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Syslog
    2. SNMP
    3. SEM
    4. SIM

    Answer:

    C, D. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a product type that combines two technologies: security event management (SEM) and security information management (SIM). Together, the two provide a combined solution for gathering and analyzing information about a network's security events. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a technology that gathers information about managed devices. Syslog is a standard designed to facilitate the transmission of log entries generated by a device or process, such as the sendmail Simple Network Management Protocol (SMTP) server, across an Internet Protocol (IP) network to a message collector, called a syslog server. Neither SNMP nor syslog capabilities are typically included in SIEM products.
9.  Which of the following statements about web server logs is not true?

    1. To analyze web server activity, you typically use an application that interprets the web server log files.
    2. Web server logs are typically maintained as text files.
    3. Web server logs record the IP addresses of all visiting users.
    4. To interpret web server logs, you use a protocol analyzer.

    Answer:

    D. A protocol analyzer provides information about network traffic; it does not interpret web server logs. Most web servers maintain logs that track the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other information about all hits and visits. The logs are stored as text files and contain a great deal of information, but in their raw form, they are difficult to interpret. Therefore, it is common practice to use a traffic analysis application that reads the log files and displays their contents in a more user-friendly form, such as tables and graphs.
10. Which of the following statements best describes a baseline?

    1. A baseline is an estimation of expected performance levels, based on manufacturersâ€™ specifications.
    2. A baseline is a record of performance levels captured under actual workload conditions.
    3. A baseline is a record of performance levels captured under simulated workload conditions.
    4. A baseline is a record of performance levels captured before the system is actually in use.

    Answer:

    B. A baseline is a record of a system's performance under real-world operating conditions, captured for later comparison as conditions change. The workload during a baseline capture should be genuine, not simulated or estimated.
11. When monitoring performance metrics on one of your servers, you notice that the server is utilizing 100 percent of the network bandwidth available to it. What modification could you make to the server that will most likely address the problem?

    1. Add memory to the system.
    2. Install a second network adapter.
    3. Update the network adapter's firmware.
    4. Install a second processor.

    Answer:

    B. If a server is using all of its network bandwidth, then the most logical solution is to add more. You can do this by installing a second network adapter and connecting it to a different subnet. The other solutions could conceivably address the problem, but their success is less likely.
12. Which of the following indicators is typically not included in an operating system's performance monitoring tool, such as the Windows Performance Monitor or the MacOS Activity Monitor?

    1. Temperature
    2. CPU/processor activity
    3. Memory consumption
    4. Network utilization
    5. Storage statistics

    Answer:

    A. Performance monitoring utilities typically provide statistics on the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, network, and disk usage, but not computer temperature monitoring.
13. Which of the following syslog message severity levels indicates that a system is unusable?

    1. 0
    2. 1
    3. 2
    4. 3
    5. 4

    Answer:

    A. Every syslog message includes a single-digit severity code. Code 0 is the most severe, indicating an emergency that has rendered the system unusable. Severity code 1 is an alert message, indicating that immediate action is needed. Severity code 2 is a critical condition message, and code 3 is an error condition. Code 4 is a warning message.
14. Which of the following syslog message severity levels indicates a call for immediate action?

    1. 0
    2. 1
    3. 2
    4. 3
    5. 4

    Answer:

    B. Every syslog message includes a single-digit severity code. Severity code 1 is an alert message, indicating that immediate action is needed. Code 0 is the most severe, indicating an emergency that has rendered the system unusable. Severity code 2 is a critical condition message, and code 3 is an error condition. Code 4 is a warning message.
15. Which of the following syslog message severity levels indicates that the message is purely informational?

    1. 0
    2. 2
    3. 4
    4. 6
    5. 7

    Answer:

    D. Every syslog message includes a single-digit severity code. Code 6 indicates that the message is purely informational. Code 0 is the most severe, indicating an emergency that has rendered the system unusable. Severity code 2 is a critical condition message, and code 4 is a warning message. Code 7 is used strictly for debugging.
16. A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) console can inform administrators when a managed device requires attention. For this to occur, the agent in the device first has to send a message to the console. What is the term used for a message sent by an SNMP agent to the central console?

    1. Ping
    2. Alert
    3. Notification
    4. Trap

    Answer:

    D. Messages that SNMP agents send to consoles when an event needing attention occurs are called traps. _Alerts_ and _notifications_ are terms for the messages that the console sends to administrators. A ping is an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request message sent from one TCP/IP computer to another.
17. Which of the following metrics would you typically not find displayed by an interface monitor?

    1. Error rate
    2. Bandwidth utilization
    3. Packet drops
    4. Rollbacks

    Answer:

    D. The term _rollback_ refers to the process of uninstalling or downgrading an update patch; it has nothing to do with monitoring a network interface. An interface monitor does typically display the number of transmission errors that occur on an interface, the amount of the available bandwidth that the interface is using, and the number of packets that have been dropped due to errors or discards.
18. Which of the following are reasons contributing to the number of packet drops displayed by an interface monitor? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Resets
    2. Discards
    3. Errors
    4. Overflows

    Answer:

    B, C. The packet drops displayed by an interface monitor are caused by errors, such as malformed or unreadable packets, or discards, which are packets that are dropped because they are destined for another interface. Resets and overflows are not reasons for packet drops.
19. Which of the following is not a statistic that you would typically find in a server performance baseline?

    1. CPU utilization
    2. Disk transfer rate
    3. Network transmissions speed
    4. OS update history
    5. Memory utilization

    Answer:

    D. Performance baselines characterize hardware performance, so the OS update history would be of little or no use for future comparisons. A baseline typically consists of CPU, memory, disk, and network performance statistics.
20. Log management typically consists of which of the following tasks? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Rollback
    2. Utilization
    3. Security
    4. Cycling

    Answer:

    C, D. Logs frequently contain sensitive information, so securing them with the appropriate permissions is an essential part of log management. Logs also can grow to overwhelm the storage medium on which they are stored, so cycling is a technique for managing log size by configuring it to delete the oldest record each time a new one is added. Rollback and utilization are not log management tasks.
21. Which of the following Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) processes performs searches for specific criteria, during specific time frames, in logs located on different computers?

    1. Data aggregation
    2. Forensic analysis
    3. Correlation
    4. Retention

    Answer:

    B. In SIEM, forensic analysis is a process of searching logs on multiple computers for specific information based on set criteria and time periods. Data aggregation is a process of consolidating log information from multiple sources. Correlation is the process of linking logged events with common attributes together. Retention is the long-term storage of log data.
22. Which of the following terms best describes the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) process of consolidating log information from multiple sources?

    1. Data aggregation
    2. Forensic analysis
    3. Correlation
    4. Retention

    Answer:

    A. In SIEM, data aggregation is a process of consolidating log information from multiple sources. Forensic analysis is a process of searching logs on multiple computers for specific information based on set criteria and time periods. Correlation is the process of linking logged events with common attributes together. Retention is the long-term storage of log data.
23. Which of the following terms best describes a connectivity problem on wired networks that is caused by individual packets that are delayed due to network congestion, different routing, or queuing problems?

    1. Latency
    2. Attenuation
    3. Jitter
    4. Bottleneck

    Answer:

    C. When individual packets in a data stream are delayed, the resulting connectivity problem is called jitter. Although this condition might not cause problems for asynchronous applications, real-time communications, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or streaming video, can suffer interruptions, from which the phenomenon gets its name. Latency describes a generalized delay in network transmissions, not individual packet delays. Attenuation is the weakening of a signal as it travels through a network medium. A bottleneck is a condition in which all traffic is delayed, due to a faulty or inadequate component.
24. Which of the following network interface occurrences are considered to be malfunctions on a full-duplex Ethernet network? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Runts
    2. Giants
    3. Collisions
    4. Late collisions

    Answer:

    A, B, C, D. All of these occurrences are malfunctions on a full-duplex Ethernet network. Runt frames occur when a network interface generates packets that are smaller than the 64-byte minimum allowable length. Giants occur when frames are larger than the 1518-byte maximum allowable length. Collisions are normal on a half-duplex network, but on a full-duplex network, collisions are considered to be malfunctions. Late collisions occur when network cables are too long.
25. Which of the following network applications are most likely to be obviously affected by the wired network connectivity problem known as jitter? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Email
    2. VoIP
    3. Streaming video
    4. Instant messaging

    Answer:

    B, C. Jitter is a connectivity problem on wired networks that is caused by individual packets that are delayed due to network congestion, different routing, or queuing problems. When individual packets in a data stream are delayed, the resulting connectivity problem is called jitter. While this condition might not cause problems for asynchronous applications, such as email and instant messaging, real-time communications, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or streaming video, can suffer intermittent interruptions, from which the phenomenon gets its name.
26. Which of the following, originally created for the UNIX sendmail program, is now a standard for message logging that enables tools that generate, store, and analyze log information to work together?

    1. Syslog
    2. Netmon
    3. Netstat
    4. Top

    Answer:

    A. Syslog is a standard designed to facilitate the transmission of log entries generated by a device or process, such as the sendmail SMTP server, across an Internet Protocol (IP) network to a message collector, called a syslog server. Network Monitor (Netmon) is a protocol analyzer. Netstat is a program that displays status information about a system's network connections. Top is a utility to display system processes. None of these provide logging services.
27. Which of the following log types is the first place that a Windows administrator should look for information about a server's activities?

    1. System log
    2. Setup log
    3. Application log
    4. Security log

    Answer:

    A. System logs document the server's startup activities and the ongoing status of its services and device drivers. When a problem occurs or the server's status changes, the system logs can provide information about what happened and when.
28. When a service fails to start on a Windows server, an entry is typically created in which of the following event logs?

    1. Application
    2. Security
    3. Setup
    4. System

    Answer:

    D. On a Windows system, information about services, including successful service starts and failures, is recorded in the System event log. The Application, Security, and Setup logs typically do not contain this type of information.
29. Which of the following Windows applications would you most likely use to create a baseline of system or network performance?

    1. Performance Monitor
    2. Event Viewer
    3. Syslog
    4. Network Monitor

    Answer:

    A. Performance Monitor is a Windows application that can create logs of specific system and network performance statistics over extended periods. Such a log created on a new computer can function as a baseline for future troubleshooting. Event Viewer is a Windows application for displaying system log files; it cannot create a performance baseline. Syslog is a log compilation program originally created for Unix systems; it does not create performance baselines. Network Monitor is a protocol analyzer. Although it can capture a traffic sample that can function as a reference for future troubleshooting efforts, this ability cannot be called a performance baseline.
30. At what humidity level do electronic components become vulnerable to damage from electrostatic shock?

    1. Below 30 percent
    2. Below 50 percent
    3. Above 70 percent
    4. Above 90 percent

    Answer:

    B. Humidity prevents the buildup of static electricity that can cause discharges that damage equipment. Humidity levels of 50 percent or lower can cause equipment to be susceptible to electrostatic shock.
31. Which of the following event logs on a Windows server can record information about both successful and failed access attempts?

    1. System
    2. Application
    3. Security
    4. Setup

    Answer:

    C. When you enable audit policies on Windows systems, you can specify whether to audit successful or failed events (or both), including access attempts. This audit information is recorded in the Security event log. The System, Application, and Setup events logs typically do not record both successful and failed access attempts.
32. Which of the following is the database used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to store information gathered from agents distributed about the network?

    1. Trap
    2. Syslog
    3. MIB
    4. SIEM

    Answer:

    C. A Management Information Base (MIB) is the database on an SNMP console where all of the information gathered from the network is stored. A trap is an alert message that SNMP agents send to the network management console. Syslog is a standard for message logging components. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a combination tool that uses information gathered from logs and network devices to provide a real-time analysis of the network's security condition.
33. Which of the following is the most likely cause of runt and giant frames on an Ethernet network interface?

    1. A network adapter malfunction
    2. Half-duplex communication
    3. Excessive cable length
    4. Electromagnetic interference

    Answer:

    A. Runts and giants are typically the result of a network interface adapter malfunction. Runt frames occur on an Ethernet network when a network interface generates packets that are smaller than the 64-byte minimum allowable length. Giants occur when frames are larger than the 1518-byte maximum allowable length. Collisions are normal on a half-duplex network, but runts and giants are not. Late collisions occur when network cables are too long. Electromagnetic interference is a likely cause of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors, but not runts and giants.
34. Which of the following is the most likely cause of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors on an Ethernet network interface?

    1. Half-duplex communication
    2. A network adapter malfunction
    3. Electromagnetic interference
    4. Excessive cable length

    Answer:

    C. Electromagnetic interference is the likely cause of CRC errors. A network interface adapter malfunction can cause runts and giant frames. Collisions are normal on a half-duplex network, but CRC errors are not. Late collisions occur when network cables are too long, but they do not cause CRC errors.
35. Which of the following utilities can display the number of packets sent and received for a specific network interface on a Unix, Linux, MacOS or Windows computer?

    1. Top
    2. Ifconfig
    3. Netstat
    4. Nbtstat

    Answer:

    C. The netstat utility can display the incoming and outgoing packets for a specific network interface, as well as other statistics, depending on the operating system. Top and ifconfig are Unix/Linux utilities, and Nbtstat is a Windows tool.
36. Which of the following is a feature included in some routers that collects and analyzes network traffic data sent or received through a network interface?

    1. Netmon
    2. Netflow
    3. Netstat
    4. Nbtstat

    Answer:

    B. Netflow is a network traffic monitoring feature first introduced in Cisco routers in 1996. Netmon, Netstat, and Nbtstat are all operating system utilities, not router features.
37. Which of the following is not a type of error typically found in network interface statistics?

    1. Runt
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Giant
    4. CRC
    5. Jumbo

    Answer:

    E. Jumbo frames is a feature supported by some Ethernet implementations that enable frames to exceed the 1500-byte maximum data payload defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard. Runt frames, giant frames, Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) errors, and encapsulation errors are all types of errors typically reported in network interface diagnostics.
38. Which of the following is not an SNMP component?

    1. MIBs
    2. Traps
    3. OIDs
    4. CRCs

    Answer:

    D. Cyclical Redundancy Checks (CRCs) are faults that occur when data does not arrive at its destination in the same state as when it was sent; they are not Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) components. Management Information Bases (MIBs), traps, and Object Identifiers (OIDs) are all components of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) implementation.
39. Ralph is designing the HVAC implementation for his company's new central datacenter, which will house all of the equipment for the corporate headquarters and the company's manufacturing facility. The datacenter must adhere to the Tier III standard defined by the Uptime Institute, which calls for at least 99.9 percent uptime. As part of the environmental infrastructure for the datacenter, Ralph plans to install sensors to monitor environmental factors that can affect computer equipment and generate alerts when conditions exceed accepted thresholds. Which of the following environmental factors is not one of those that Ralph should arrange to monitor to protect the equipment specific to a datacenter?

    1. Flood
    2. Humidity
    3. Radon
    4. Static electricity
    5. Temperature

    Answer:

    C. Unless there is a specific known threat at the datacenter location, radon is not one of the environmental factors that typically can affect equipment uptime and that needs to be monitored. Temperature, humidity, flooding, and static electricity, however, are factors that should be monitored in a datacenter, as variations of these elements can result in equipment damage and downtime.
40. Routers using link states and Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the lowest cost route to a specific destination can conceivably be running which of the following interior gateway routing protocols? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. OSPF
    2. RIP
    3. EIGRP
    4. IS-IS
    5. BGP

    Answer:

    A, D. Link states and Dijkstra's algorithm are used by link state routing protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System â€“ Intermediate System (IS â€“ IS). Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) are distance vector protocols, which do not use link states. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a distance vector protocol and an exterior (not interior) gateway protocol.
41. Which of the following is the term usually applied to a representation of network devices, automatically compiled, and containing information such as IP addresses and connection speeds?

    1. Network map
    2. Network diagram
    3. Cable diagram
    4. Management information base

    Answer:

    A. A network map is a depiction of network devices, not drawn to scale, with additional information added, such as IP addresses and link speeds. In most cases, network maps are automatically created by a software product, such as Nmap, that scans the network and creates a display from the information it discovers. The term _network diagram_ is most often used to refer to a manually created document containing pictograms of network devices, with lines representing the connections between them. The diagram might be roughly similar to the actual layout of the site, but it is usually not drawn to scale. A cable diagram is a precise depiction of the cable runs installed in a site. Often drawn on an architect's floor plan or blueprint, the cable diagram enables network administrators to locate specific cables and troubleshoot connectivity problems. A Management Information Base (MIB) is a component of a network management system that is based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and contains information about only one device; it does not depict all of the devices on the network.
42. Which of the following types of network documentation is often overlaid on an architectural drawing or blueprint?

    1. Network map
    2. Network diagram
    3. Cable diagram
    4. Management information base

    Answer:

    C. A cable diagram is a precise depiction of the cable runs installed in a site.

43. Which of the following is not one of the typical heights for devices mounted in IT equipment racks?

    1. 1 unit
    2. 2 units
    3. 3 units
    4. 4 units

    Answer:

    C. Devices designed to fit into IT equipment racks typically have heights measured in units. One unit equals 1.75 inches. Most rack-mounted devices are one (1U), two (2U), or four units (4U) tall.
44. The cable plant for your company network was installed several years ago by an outside contractor. Now, some of the paper labels have fallen off your patch panels, and you do not know which wall plate is connected to each port. Assuming that you are working on a properly maintained and documented network installation, which of the following is the easiest way to determine which port is connected to which wall plate?

    1. Consult the cable diagram provided by the cabling contractor at the time of the installation.
    2. Call the cable installation contractor and see if he or she can remember which ports go with which wall plates.
    3. Attach a tone generator to a patch panel port and then test each wall plate with a locator until you find the correct one. Repeat this for each port that needs labeling.
    4. Use a cable certifier to locate the patch panel port associated with each wall plate port.

    Answer:

    A. A reputable cable installer should supply a cable diagram that indicates the locations of all the cable runs on a plan or blueprint of the site. You should be able to use this to determine which ports go with which wall plates. A busy cable installer is unlikely to remember specific details about an installation performed years ago. Using a tone generator and locator is an effective way to associate ports and wall plates, but it can be incredibly time consuming and is certainly not the easiest method. A cable certifier can test the cable run for faults, measure its length, and perform other tests, but it cannot specify which wall plate goes with which port, unless you entered that information yourself earlier.
45. Which of the following IT asset management documents published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines a standard for Software Identification Tags (SWIDs) containing inventory information about the software running on a computer or other device?

    1. ISO 19770-1
    2. ISO 19770-2
    3. ISO 19770-3
    4. ISO 19770-4
    5. ISO 19770-5

    Answer:

    B. ISO 19770 is a family of IT Asset Management (ITAM) standards that defines procedures and technology for the management of software and related assets in a corporate infrastructure. ISO 19770-2 defines the creation and use of SWID tags, which are XML files containing management and identification information about a specific software product. The other standards define other ITAM elements, such as compliance with corporate governance (ISO 19770-1) and resource utilization measurement (ISO 19770-4).
46. Which of the following are places where network wiring connections are found? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. MDF
    2. MTBF
    3. IDF
    4. RDP

    Answer:

    A, C. A large enterprise network willâ€”at minimumâ€”have demarcation points for telephone services and a connection to an Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network. In many cases, these services will enter the building in the same equipment room that houses the backbone switch. This room is then called the Main Distribution Frame (MDF). An Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) is the location of localized telecommunications equipment such as the interface between the horizontal cabling and the backbone. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) are not locations of network wiring.
47. A rack diagram is typically ruled vertically using which of the following measurements?

    1. Inches
    2. Centimeters
    3. Units
    4. Grids

    Answer:

    1. A switch
    2. A router
    3. A hub
    4. A gateway

    Answer:

    A. The symbol shown in the figure represents a network switch. It is not a router, a hub, or a gateway.
49. Which of the following statements are true about the differences between a diagram of a patch panel installation organized physically and one that is organized logically? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. A physical diagram is organized according to the floors and rooms where the cable drops are located.
    2. A physical diagram is precisely scaled to represent the actual patch panel hardware.
    3. A logical diagram is organized according to the divisions within the company, such as departments and workgroups.
    4. A logical diagram uses an organization that represents company divisions but does not physically resemble the actual patch panels.

    Answer:

    A, C. A physical diagram, in this case, represents the actual physical locations of the cable drops connected to the patch panels. A logical diagram uses artificial divisions that correspond to the organization of the company.
50. A diagram of a telecommunications room or Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) for an office building is typically based on which of the following?

    1. A hand-drawn sketch
    2. A series of photographs
    3. An architect's plan
    4. A 3D model
    5. A site survey report

    Answer:

    C. IDF diagrams should be based on an architect's plan whenever possible so that actual lengths and locations of cable runs can be documented. In situations where an architect's plan is not available, a detailed sketch, drawn to scale, can be acceptable. Photographs, models, and reports are impractical for this purpose.
51. The documentation for Main Distribution Frames (MDFs) and Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs) should incorporate details on which of the following elements? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Power
    2. Environment
    3. Distances
    4. Costs

    Answer:

    A, B, C. MDF and IDF documentation should take into account the power sources available at the locations, the HVAC equipment needed to keep the temperature and humidity levels under control, and the distances the cable runs must span. This type of documentation is typically used for installation and troubleshooting purposes, so the costs of components and services are unnecessary and can be covered elsewhere.
52. At what point in the installation process should patch panel ports and wall plates be labeled?

    1. When the patch panels and wall plates are installed
    2. When a length of cable is cut from the spool
    3. When the cables are attached to the connectors
    4. When the cable runs are tested, immediately after their installation

    Answer:

    C. Patch panel ports and wall plates should be labeled when the cable runs are attached to them. Labeling them at any earlier time can result in cable runs being connected incorrectly.
53. Which of the following is the term used to describe a wiring nexus that is typically the termination point for incoming telephone and Wide Area Network (WAN) services?

    1. MDF
    2. MTBF
    3. IDF
    4. RDP
    5. MOU

    Answer:

    A. A large enterprise network willâ€”at minimumâ€”have demarcation points for telephone services and a connection to an Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network. In many cases, these services will enter the building in the same equipment room that houses the backbone switch. This room is then called the Main Distribution Frame (MDF). An Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) is the location of localized telecommunications equipment such as the interface between the horizontal cabling and the backbone. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are not locations of network wiring.
54. Your department is experiencing frequent delays as users wait for images to render using their outdated graphics software package. As a result, you are planning to submit a change request for a new software product at the monthly meeting of the company's change management team. Which of the following types of information are likely to be included in your request? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. The possibility of rolling back to the previous software, if necessary
    2. The procedure for installing and configuring the new software
    3. An estimate of the productivity increase realizable with the new software
    4. A list of software and hardware upgrades or modifications needed to run the new software

    Answer:

    A, B, C, D. A change management team typically requires thorough documentation for all requested changes, specifying exactly what is needed; how the change will affect the current workflow, both to the direct recipients of the change and the rest of the organization; and what ramifications might come from the change.
55. A rack diagram is typically ruled into vertical rack units, which are standard-sized divisions that hardware manufacturers use when manufacturing rack-mountable components. Which of the following is the standard vertical height of a single rack unit?

    1. 1.721 inches
    2. 1.75 inches
    3. 40 mm
    4. 3.5 inches

    Answer:

    B. A single rack unit is 1.75 inches, or 44.5 mm. Option A, 1.721 inches, is the height used for many components that are one rack unit tall, leaving a small space between components for easy insertion and removal.
56. The change request for new graphics software that you submitted to your company's change management team has been approved. Now it is time to implement the change. Which of the following administrative tasks will most likely be the change management team's responsibility during the implementation process? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Authorizing downtime
    2. Notifying users
    3. Designating a maintenance window
    4. Documenting all modifications made

    Answer:

    A, C. The change management team is usually not responsible for tasks directly involved in the implementation of the changes they approve. Therefore, they would not be the ones to notify users exactly when the change will take place or document the procedure afterward. They would, however, be responsible for providing a maintenance window, during which the change must occur, and authorizing any downtime that would be needed.
57. Which of the following IT asset management documents published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides an overview of the ITAM concepts discussed in the ISO 19770 family of standards?

    1. ISO 19770-1
    2. ISO 19770-2
    3. ISO 19770-3
    4. ISO 19770-4
    5. ISO 19770-5

    Answer:

    E. ISO 19770 is a family of IT Asset Management (ITAM) standards that defines procedures and technology for the management of software and related assets in a corporate infrastructure. ISO 19770-5 provides a general overview of the functions provided by the standards and their benefits to an IT infrastructure. The other standards define other ITAM elements, such as compliance with corporate governance (ISO 19770-1), creation and use of software ID (SWID) tags (ISO 19770-2), and resource utilization measurement (ISO 19770-4).
58. A rack-mounted device that is four units tall will be approximately what height in inches?

    1. 1.75
    2. 3.5
    3. 4
    4. 7

    Answer:

    D. The standard unit height for IT equipment racks is 1.75 inches, which is the equivalent of one unit. Four units would therefore be 7 inches.

    1. Physical network diagram
    2. Asset management
    3. Logical network diagram
    4. Wiring schematic

    Answer:

    D. The main purpose of a wiring schematic is to indicate where cables are located in walls and ceilings. A physical network diagram identifies all of the physical devices and how they connect together. Asset management is the identification, documentation, and tracking of all network assets, including computers, routers, switches, and so on. A logical network diagram contains addresses, firewall configurations, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and other logical elements of the network configuration.
60. Which of the following statements about physical network diagrams and logical network diagrams are true? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. A physical network diagram is created automatically, and a logical network diagram is created manually.
    2. A physical network diagram depicts hardware devices and the connections between them.
    3. A logical network diagram contains all of the information you would need to rebuild your network from scratch.
    4. A logical network diagram typically contains the IP addresses of network devices.

    Answer:

    B, D. A physical network diagram identifies all of the physical devices and how they connect together. A logical network diagram contains IP addresses, firewall configurations, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and other logical elements of the network configuration. Both physical and logical network diagrams can be created automatically or manually. It is the physical network diagram that contains the information needed to rebuild the network from scratch.
61. In a standard Cisco network diagram, what component does the symbol in the figure represent?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713089107.3d40f2b6ad6609b2e2b85a64373a6494f4c71afd/eod/books/158796/images/c03uf003.jpg" alt="" height="228" width="227"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. MDF
    2. MTBF
    3. IDF
    4. SLA
    5. MOU

    Answer:

    C. An Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) is the location of localized telecommunications equipment such as the interface between a horizontal network, which connects to workstations and other user devices, and the network backbone. A large enterprise network will typically have demarcation points for telephone services and a connection to an Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network. In many cases, these services will enter the building in the same equipment room that houses the backbone switch. This room is then called the Main Distribution Frame (MDF). Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) are not locations of network wiring.
63. What is the width of a standard equipment rack in a datacenter?

    1. 12 inches

    1. A switch
    2. A router
    3. A hub
    4. A gateway

    Answer:

    C. The symbol shown in the figure represents a network hub. It is not a switch, a router, or a gateway.
65. The precise locations of devices in a datacenter are typically documented in which of the following documents?

    1. Rack diagram
    2. Network map
    3. Wiring schematic
    4. Logical diagram
    5. Business continuity plan
    6. Audit and assessment report

    Answer:

    A. Datacenters typically mount components in racks, 19-inch-wide and approximately 6-foot-tall frameworks in which many networking components are specifically designed to fit. A rack diagram is a depiction of one or more racks, ruled out in standardized 1.752-inch rack units, and showing the exact location of each piece of equipment mounted in the rack. Network maps, wiring schematics, and logical diagrams are documents that define the relationships between components, not their precise locations. A business continuity plan describes the organization's disaster prevention and recovery policies. An audit and assessment report is a documentâ€”often prepared by a third partyâ€”that summarizes the organization's security posture.
66. Which of the following statements about network maps is true?

    1. Network maps are typically drawn to scale.
    2. Network maps typically contain more information than network diagrams.
    3. Network maps must be read/write accessible to all personnel working on the network.
    4. Network maps diagram only the locations of cable runs and endpoints.

    Answer:

    B. Network diagrams typically specify device types and connections, but network maps can also include IP addresses, link speeds, and other information. Network maps diagram the relationships between devices, and provide information about the links that connect them, but they are not drawn to scale and usually do not indicate the exact location of each device. Although universal accessibility would be desirable, there are individuals who should not have access to network maps and other documentation, including temporary employees and computer users not involved in IT work. A network map includes all networking devices, not just cable runs and endpoints.
67. Which of the following types of documentation should contain the chemical composition of all cleaning compounds used in a datacenter?

    1. ESD
    2. MSDS
    3. NDA
    4. BYOD
    5. SOP

    Answer:

    B. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is a document created by manufacturers of chemical, electrical, and mechanical products, specifying the potential dangers and risks associated with them, particularly in regard to exposure or fire. A properly documented network should have MSDS documents on file for all of the chemical and hardware products used to build and maintain it. MSDSs can be obtained from the manufacturer or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Electrostatic discharges (ESDs), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are not concerned with the chemical composition of cleaning compounds.

    1. Remote access policies
    2. Service level agreement
    3. Acceptable use policy
    4. Privileged user agreement

    Answer:

    D. A privileged user agreement specifies the abilities and limitations of users with respect to the administrative accounts and other privileges they have been granted. Remote access policies specify when and how users are permitted to access the company network from remote locations. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a provider and a subscriber that specifies the guaranteed availability of the service. Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) specify whether and how employees can utilize company-owned hardware and software resources.
69. You are working for a company with numerous branch offices scattered around the country, and you are required to travel to these offices frequently. Each branch office has some means of accessing the network at the company headquarters. Some use frame relay, some use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and a few even use dial-in access. During one trip, you mention to a branch office manager that you intend to connect to the headquarters network that night from your hotel room. The manager warns you that this is against company policy, but you are not so sure. Where in the company documentation should you look to confirm this?

    1. Remote access policies
    2. Service level agreement
    3. Acceptable use policy
    4. Privileged user agreement

    Answer:

    A. Remote access policies specify when and how users are permitted to access the company network from remote locations.

    1. SLA
    2. AUP
    3. NDA
    4. BYOD

    Answer:

    B. Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) specify whether and how employees can utilize company-owned hardware and software resources. AUPs typically specify what personal work employees can perform, what hardware and software they can install, and what levels of privacy they are permitted when using company equipment. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a provider and a subscriber. A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) specifies what company information employees are permitted to discuss outside the company. A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy specifies how employees can connect their personal devices to the company network.
71. Many employees have been contacting the IT help desk asking how they can connect their personal smartphones and tablets to the company's wireless network. This has raised issues regarding network security and technical support. You have been asked to draft a policy for the in-house use of personal electronics that addresses these issues. Which of the following describes the document that you will be creating?

    1. SLA
    2. AUP
    3. NDA
    4. BYOD

    Answer:

    D. A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy specifies the personal electronics that employees are permitted to use on the company network and documents the procedures for connecting and securing them. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a provider and a subscriber that specifies the percentage of time that the contracted services are available. Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) specify whether and how employees can utilize company-owned hardware and software resources. A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) specifies what company information employees are permitted to discuss outside the company.
72. You are going to work for a new company as a software developer, and Human Resources (HR) has notified you that you must sign a document guaranteeing that you will maintain confidentiality about the company's products and programming code in perpetuity. Which of the following documents contains this agreement?

    1. SLA

    C. A Non-Disclosure agreement (NDA) specifies what company information employees are permitted to discuss outside the company. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a provider and a subscriber that specifies the percentage of time that the contracted services are available. Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) specify whether and how employees can utilize company-owned hardware and software resources. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is a document outlining an agreement between two parties that precedes the signing of a contract. A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy specifies the personal electronics that employees are permitted to use on the company network and documents the procedures for connecting and securing them.
73. Which of the following are typical elements of a corporate password policy? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Minimum password length
    2. Use of special characters
    3. Unique passwords
    4. Frequent password changes

    Answer:

    A, B, C, D. The longer the password, the more difficult it is to guess. Corporate policies typically require passwords of a minimum length. A larger character set also makes a password more difficult to guess, so requiring upper- and lowercase, numeric, and special characters is common. Changing passwords forces the attack process to start over, so policies typically require frequent password changes and prevent users from reusing passwords.
74. Alice is implementing a new password policy that requires all users to change their passwords every seven days. What further modification can she make to the password policy to prevent users from thwarting the password change requirement?

    1. Specify a minimum password length
    2. Require the use of special characters
    3. Require the creation of unique passwords
    4. Specify a maximum password change interval

    Answer:

    C. Requiring unique passwords can prevent users from thwarting a password change policy by reusing the same passwords over and over. Password length, password character sets, and password change interval maximums can do nothing to thwart a frequent password change policy.
75. Which of the following are settings typically included in an account lockout policy? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Account lockout duration
    2. Time allowed between attempts
    3. Account lockout threshold
    4. Reset account lockout threshold counter

    Answer:

    A, C, D. Account lockout threshold specifies the number of incorrect logon attempts that are allowed before the account is locked out. Account lockout duration is the amount of time that an account remains locked out. Reset account lockout threshold counter specifies the amount of time before the number of incorrect attempts is reset to zero. Account lockout policies typically do not include a setting that regulates the amount of time allowed between logon attempts.
76. How do account lockouts help to prevent intruders from cracking passwords?

    1. By forcing users to select passwords of a minimum length
    2. By preventing users from entering incorrect passwords more than a specified number of times
    3. By preventing users from reusing the same passwords
    4. By requiring an additional authentication method, such as a fingerprint

    Answer:

    B. Account lockouts limit the number of incorrect passwords that a user can enter. This prevents intruders from using a brute force attack to crack the account by trying password after password. After a specified number of incorrect tries, the account is locked for a specified length of time or until an administrator unlocks it.
77. Which of the following data loss prevention terms is used to describe dangers pertaining to data that is being transmitted over a network? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Data in use
    2. Data at rest

81. The terms _on-boarding_ and _off-boarding_ are typically associated with which of the following policies?

    1. Data loss prevention
    2. Incident response
    3. Inventory management
    4. Identity management
    5. Disaster recovery
    6. Business continuity

    Answer:

    D. On-boarding and off-boarding are identity management processes in which users are added or removed from an organization's identity and access management (IAM) system. This grants new users the privileges they need to use the network, modifies their privileges if they change positions, and revokes privileges when they leave the company. On-boarding and off-boarding are not data loss prevention, incident response, inventory management, disaster recovery, or business continuity processes.
82. The term _off-boarding_ refers to which of the following procedures?

    1. Removing a node from a cluster
    2. Disconnecting all cables from a switch
    3. Revoking a user's network privileges
    4. Retiring old workstations

    Answer:

    C. On-boarding and off-boarding are identity management processes in which users are added or removed from an organization's identity and access management (IAM) system. Off-boarding revokes a user's privileges when he or she leaves the company. The term _off-boarding_ does not refer to cluster management, disconnecting a switch, or retiring workstations.
83. Which of the following is most likely to be the last step in a change management procedure?

    1. Documentation
    2. Notification
    3. Approval
    4. Scheduling

    Answer:

    A. After a change is requested, approved, scheduled, and performed, everyone involved should be notified, and the entire process should be documented for future reference.

    1. The company that created the software
    2. Department of State
    3. Department of Commerce
    4. Department of the Treasury

    Answer:

    B, C, D. The U.S. government controls exports of sensitive software and other technology as a means to maintain national security interests and foreign policy agreements. Three U.S. agencies have the authority to issue export licenses: the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Treasury. Individual software developers do not have the authority to impose their own export controls.
85. Which of the following is the primary result of an organization's security incident response policies?

    1. To know how to respond to a particular incident
    2. To prevent an incident from occurring again
    3. To identify the cause of an incident
    4. To document the procedures leading up to an incident

    Answer:

    B. While incident response policies might include the process of responding to an incident and identifying and documenting its cause, the primary function of incident response policies is to ensure that the same incident does not happen again.
86. You are an IT director, and a fire has broken out in the lower floors of your company's office building. After the personnel are evacuated, the fire department asks you where they can find documentation about all chemicals and equipment used in the company's datacenter, which is threatened by the fire.

    1. ESD
    2. NDA
    3. BYOD
    4. MSDS

    Answer:

    D. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) are documents created by manufacturers of chemical, electrical, and mechanical products, which specify the potential risks and dangers associated with them, particularly in regard to flammability and the possibility of toxic outgassing. A properly documented network should have MSDS documents on file for all of the chemical and hardware products used to build and maintain it. MSDSs can be obtained from the manufacturers or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Electrostatic discharges (ESDs), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies are not concerned with the dangers inherent in building contents.
87. You have been asked to draft an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for new hires at your company to sign, which specifies what they can and cannot do when working with the company's computers and network. Which of the following is not one of the provisions typically found in this type of document?

    1. Privacy
    2. Ownership
    3. Illegal use
    4. Upgrades

    Answer:

    D. Software and hardware upgrades are typically not part of an AUP, because they are handled by the company's IT personnel. An AUP for a company typically includes a clause indicating that users have no right to privacy for anything they do using the company's computers, including email and data storage. An AUP usually specifies that the company is the sole owner of the computer equipment and any proprietary company information stored on it or available through it. The AUP also prohibits the use of its computers or network for any illegal practices, typically including spamming, hacking, or malware introduction or development.
88. You are starting a new job, and the company's Human Resources (HR) department has asked you to sign an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) regarding computer and network use. The document includes a privacy clause. Which of the following are specifications you can expect to find in this clause? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Any emails you send or receive can be monitored by the company at any time.
    2. All files and data that you store on company computers must be accessible to the company for scanning and monitoring.
    3. All work that you perform for the company becomes the sole property of the company, including copyrights and patents.
    4. All hardware, software, and any proprietary data stored on the company's computers remains the property of the company.

    Answer:

    A, B. Clauses regarding company property, including the copyrights and patents for the work performed for the company, typically do appear in an AUP but not in the privacy clause. This information would be more likely to appear in an ownership clause. The privacy clause commonly explains that the company has the right to access and monitor anything stored on its computers.
89. Which of the following tasks is not considered to be part of an IT department's incident response plan?

    1. Stopping an ongoing incident
    2. Containing the damage caused by an incident
    3. Repairing the damage caused by an incident
    4. Rebuilding an infrastructure destroyed by an incident

    Answer:

    D. Once a network infrastructure has been partially or completely destroyed, it is no longer a matter of incident response; the responsibility passes over to the disaster recovery plan, which requires a different set of policies. Stopping, containing, and remediating an incident are all considered incident response policies.
90. Which of the following are occurrences that are typically addressed by an IT department's incident response policies? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
    2. Hard disk failure
    3. Electrical fire
    4. Server outage

    Answer:

    A, B, D. Attacks, hardware failures, and crashes are all events that can be addressed by incident response policies that define what is to be done to analyze and remediate the problem. An electrical fire is typically not something that would be addressed by an IT department's incident response team; it is a job for trained firefighters. Once the fire is out, the company's response falls under the heading of disaster recovery.
91. Which of the following terms would apply to the procedure of adding a user's personal smartphone to the network under a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy?

    1. Out-of-band
    2. On-boarding
    3. In-band
    4. Off-boarding

    Answer:

    B. The process of adding a user's personal device and allowing it to access the company network is called on-boarding. Removing the personal device from the network would be called off-boarding. In-band and out-of-band are terms defining methods for gaining administrative access to a managed network device.
92. Your company has been acquired by another firm and, as IT director, you will have to comply with the new firm's safety policies in your datacenter and other IT workspaces. One of the new requirements states that there must be a fail closed policy for the datacenter. Which of the following best describes what this policy dictates should occur in the event of an emergency?

    1. All computers that are logged on should automatically log off.
    2. All computers that are running should automatically shut down.
    3. All doors that are normally open should lock themselves.
    4. All doors that are normally locked should open themselves.

    Answer:

    C. A fail closed policy for the datacenter specifies that any open doors should lock themselves in the event of an emergency. To support this policy, the datacenter will have to have a self-contained fire suppression system, which uses devices such as fire detectors and oxygen-displacing gas systems.
93. You are the first responder to an incident of computer crime at your company. The datacenter's security has been penetrated, a server accessed, and sensitive company data stolen. The company's incident response plan lists the specific tasks that you are responsible for performing. Which of the following are likely to be among those tasks? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Turn off the server.
    2. Secure the area.
    3. Document the scene.
    4. Collect evidence.
    5. Cooperate with the authorities.

    Answer:

    B, C, D, E. While securing the area to prevent contamination of evidence, documenting the scene with photographs or video, collecting any evidence that might be visible, and cooperating with the authorities are tasks that are likely to be in the company's incident response policy. Turning off the server most certainly would not, because this could disturb or delete evidence of the crime.
94. Password policies frequently require users to specify complex passwords. Which of the following are characteristic of a complex password?

    1. Passwords that contain mixed upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
    2. Passwords that exceed a specific length
    3. Passwords that do not duplicate a specific number of the user's previous passwords
    4. Passwords that do not duplicate the user's account name, birth date, or other personal information

    Answer:

    A. Although all of the options are characteristics of a strong password, the definition of a complex password is one that expands the available character set by using a mixture of upper- and lowercase letters, numerals, and symbols. The larger the character set used to create passwords, the more difficult they are to guess.
95. Password policies that contain a history requirement typically have which of the following limitations?

    1. Users cannot reuse recent passwords.
    2. Users cannot create passwords containing names of relatives.
    3. Users cannot create passwords containing names of historical figures.
    4. Users cannot create passwords that duplicate those of any other users on the network.

    Answer:

    A. A history requirement in a password policy prevents users from specifying any one of their most recently used passwords. Although creating passwords using the names of relatives and historical figures is not recommended, it is not something that is easy to prevent. Each user maintains his or her own password history; there is no conflict with the passwords of other users.
96. Account lockout policies are designed to protect against which of the following types of attacks?

    1. Social engineering
    2. Spoofing
    3. Brute force
    4. Man in the middle

    Answer:

    C. A brute-force password attack is one in which the perpetrator tries as many passwords as possible in an effort to guess or deduce the right one. Account lockout policies are intended to prevent this type of attack by limiting the number of incorrect password attempts.
97. Which of the following types of password policies are designed to prevent brute-force attacks? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Password length policies
    2. Account lockout policies
    3. Password history policies
    4. Complex password policies

    Answer:

    A, B, D. A brute-force password attack is one in which the perpetrator tries as many passwords as possible in an effort to guess or deduce the right one. Password length and complexity policies produce passwords that are harder to guess, making the attack statistically less likely to succeed. Account lockout policies are intended to prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of incorrect password attempts. Password history policies do not help to prevent brute-force attacks.
98. Which of the following is not likely to be a procedural element of an IT asset disposal policy?

    1. Data deletion
    2. Recycling
    3. Data preservation
    4. Inventory

    Answer:

    C. An IT asset disposal policy typically includes procedures to be performed on assets that have reached the end of their system life cycle and that are ready for final processing. This includes the wiping of all data, the completion of inventory records, and the possible recycling of the asset. The policy assumes that all data requiring preservation has already been preserved before the asset is submitted for disposal. Therefore, data preservation procedures are not needed at this phase.
99. While negotiating a new contract with a service provider, you have reached a disagreement over the contracted reliability of the service. The provider is willing to guarantee that the service will be available 99 percent of the time, but you have been told to require 99.9 percent. When you finally reach an agreement, the negotiated language will be included in which of the following documents?

    1. SLA
    2. AUP
    3. NDA
    4. BYOD

    Answer:

    A. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a provider and a subscriber that specifies the percentage of time that the contracted services are available. Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) specify whether and how employees can utilize company-owned hardware and software resources. A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) specifies what company information employees are permitted to discuss outside the company. A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy specifies the personal electronics that employees are permitted to use on the company network and documents the procedures for connecting and securing them.
100.    Which of the following elements would you typically not expect to find in a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and a subscriber?

        1. A definition of the services to be provided by the ISP
        2. A list of specifications for the equipment to be provided by the ISP
        3. The types and schedule for the technical support to be provided by the ISP
        4. The types of applications that the subscriber will use when accessing the ISP's services

        Answer:

        D. An ISP provides subscribers with access to the Internet. The applications that the subscriber uses on the internet are typically not part of the SLA. An SLA does typically specify exactly what services the ISP will supply, what equipment the ISP will provide, and the technical support services the ISP will furnish as part of the agreement.
101.    You have just completed negotiating an annual contract with a provider to furnish your company with cloud services. As part of the contract, the provider has agreed to guarantee that the services will be available 99.9 percent of the time, around the clock, seven days per week. If the services are unavailable more than 0.1 percent of the time, your company is due a price adjustment. Which of the following terms describes this clause of the contract?

        1. SLA
        2. MTBF
        3. AUP
        4. MTTR

        Answer:

        A. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a provider and a subscriber that specifies the percentage of time that the contracted services are available. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) is a hardware specification that estimates how long a particular component can be expected to function. Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) specify whether and how employees can utilize company-owned hardware and software resources. Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) specifies the average time it will take to repair a specific hardware company when it malfunctions.
102.    The technical support clause of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) will typically include which of the following elements? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Whether the provider will provide on-site, telephone, or online support
        2. The time service for responses to support calls, which specifies how quickly the provider must respond to requests for support.
        3. The percentage of time that the service is guaranteed to be available
        4. The amount of support that will be provided and the costs for additional support

        Answer:

        A, B, D. The technical support clause of an SLA typically defines the type of support that the provider will furnish, the time service for support, and the amount of support that is included in the contract, as well as the cost for additional support. An SLA will typically guarantee service ability in the form of a percentage, but this refers to problems at the provider's end and is not a customer technical support matter.
103.    After switching from a standard public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone system to a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system, users are complaining of service interruptions and problems hearing callers at certain times of the day. After examining a network traffic audit and assessment report, you determine that traffic levels on the Internet connection are substantially higher during the first and last hours of the day, the same times when most of the users experienced problems. Which of the following solutions can provide more reliable VoIP service during peak usage times?

        1. Implement traffic shaping
        2. Implement load balancing
        3. Upgrade the Local Area Network (LAN) from Fast Ethernet to Gigabit Ethernet
        4. Replace the router connecting the LAN to the Internet with a model that supports Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

        Answer:

        A. Traffic shaping is a technique for prioritizing packets by buffering packets that are not time sensitive for later transmission. You can use this technique to give VoIP packets priority over other types of traffic. Load balancing can conceivably improve the performance of a server, but it cannot help to relieve traffic congestion on the Internet link. The traffic congestion is on the Internet connection, not the LAN, so upgrading to Gigabit Ethernet will not help. SNMP is a protocol used by network management products; it will not relieve the traffic congestion problem.
104.    A server with dual power supplies must be running in which of the following modes for the system to be fault tolerant?

        1. Combined mode
        2. Redundant mode
        3. Individual mode
        4. Hot backup mode

        Answer:

        B. A server with dual power supplies can run in one of two modes: redundant or combined. In redundant mode, both power supplies are capable of providing 100 percent of the power needed by the server. Therefore, the server can continue to run if one power supply fails, making it fault tolerant. In combined mode, both power supplies are needed to provide the server's needs, so a failure of one power supply will bring the server down. Individual mode and hot backup mode are not terms used for this purpose.
105.    Redundant power circuits can enable a server to continue running in spite of which of the following events?

        1. A citywide power outage
        2. A server power supply failure
        3. An uncorrected building circuit failure
        4. A failure of the server's Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)

        Answer:

        C. If a server is connected to two building circuits, it can continue to function if the breaker for one circuit trips and remains uncorrected. All of the other options will bring the server down unless additional redundancies are in place.
106.    Which of the following media types is Windows Server Backup unable to use to store backed-up data?

        1. Local hard disks
        2. Local optical disks
        3. Magnetic tape drives
        4. Remote shared folders

        Answer:

        C. Windows Server Backup cannot back up data to magnetic tape drives. However, it can back up to local hard disks, optical disks, and remote shares.
107.    Which of the following Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) levels provides fault tolerance by storing parity information on the disks, in addition to the data? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. RAID 0
        2. RAID 1
        3. RAID 5
        4. RAID 10

        Answer:

        C. RAID is a technology for storing data on multiple hard disk drives, providing fault tolerance, increased performance, or both. The various RAID levels provide different levels of functionality and have different hardware requirements. RAID 5 combines disk striping with distributed storage of parity information, which provides fault tolerance. The parity information enables the array to rebuild a disk whose data has been lost. RAID 0 uses data striping only (blocks written to each disk in turn), which does not provide any form of fault tolerance. RAID 1 provides fault tolerance through disk mirroring. RAID 10 creates fault-tolerant mirrored stripe sets.
108.    Installing an electrical generator for your datacenter is an example of which of the following fault tolerance concepts?

        1. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
        2. Power redundancy
        3. Dual power supplies
        4. Redundant circuits

        Answer:

        B. Power redundancy is a general term describing any fault tolerance mechanism that enables equipment to continue functioning when one source of power fails. A UPS is a device that uses battery power, not a generator. The term _dual power supplies_ refers to the power supply units inside a computer, not a separate generator. The term _redundant circuits_ refers to multiple connections to the building's main power, not to a generator.
109.    Which of the following RAID levels uses disk striping with distributed parity?

        1. RAID 0
        2. RAID 1
        3. RAID 5
        4. RAID 10

        Answer:

        C. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a technology for storing data on multiple hard disk drives, providing fault tolerance, increased performance, or both. The various RAID levels provide different levels of functionality and have different hardware requirements. RAID 5 combines disk striping (blocks written to each disk in turn) with distributed storage of parity information, for fault tolerance. RAID 0 provides data striping only. RAID 1 provides disk mirroring. RAID 10 creates mirrored stripe sets.
110.    Which of the following is not a fault tolerance mechanism?

        1. Port aggregation
        2. Clustering
        3. MTBF
        4. UPS

        Answer:

        C. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is a hardware specification used to predict the approximate lifetime of a component. It does not refer to any type of fault tolerance mechanism. Port aggregation, clustering, and Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) are all mechanisms that provide fault tolerance in the event of network adapter, server, and power failures, respectively.
111.    Which of the following is not a type of server load balancing mechanism?

        1. DNS round-robin
        2. Network Address Translation
        3. Content switching
        4. Multilayer switching

        Answer:

        B. Load balancing is a method of distributing incoming traffic among multiple servers. Network Address Translation (NAT) is a routing mechanism that enables computers on a private network to share one or more public Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. It is therefore not a load balancing method. Domain Name System (DNS) round-robin, multilayer switching, and content switching are all mechanisms that enable a server cluster to share client traffic.
112.    Which of the following mechanisms for load balancing web servers is able to read the incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests and perform advanced functions based on the information they contain?

        1. Content switches
        2. Multilayer switches
        3. Failover clustering
        4. DNS round-robin

        Answer:

        A. A content switch is an application layer device, which is what renders it capable of reading the incoming Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) messages. HTTP is an application layer protocol. Multilayer switches do not operate above the transport layer. Failover clustering and (DNS) round-robin are both techniques for distributing incoming traffic without actually processing it.
113.    Which of the following statements about the differences between online and standby Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) are correct? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. A standby UPS runs devices using battery power all the time.
        2. An online UPS provides no gap in the power supplied to the devices during a main power failure.
        3. An online UPS switches devices to battery power only during a main power failure.
        4. A standby UPS provides only enough power for an orderly shutdown of the devices.

        Answer:

        B, D. It is an online UPS that runs devices using battery power all the time so that there is no gap to the power supplied to devices during a failure. It is a standby UPS that switches devices to battery power during a main power failure. Both online and standby UPSs provide only enough power for an orderly shutdown of the devices.
114.    Which of the following are valid reasons why online Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) are more expensive than standby UPSs?

        1. Online UPSs enable devices to run longer when a main power failure occurs.
        2. Online UPSs enable devices to run continuously when a main power failure occurs.
        3. Online UPSs are managed devices that can generate alerts.
        4. Online UPSs provide greater protection against power spikes and sags.

        Answer:

        B. Online UPSs run devices from the battery all the time, while simultaneously keeping the battery charged. There is therefore no switchover gap when a power failure occurs. Online UPSs do not necessarily run longer than standby UPSs, nor do they provide more protection again power spikes and sags. Both online and standby UPSs can be managed devices.
115.    Which of the following are equivalent terms for the process of combining the bandwidth of two or more network adapters to increase the overall speed of the connection and provide fault tolerance? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Bonding
        2. Link aggregation
        3. Clustering
        4. Port aggregation
        5. NIC teaming

        Answer:

        A, B, D, E. Bonding, link aggregation, port aggregation, and Network Interface Card (NIC) teaming are all terms for the same basic technology, in which the bandwidth of multiple network adapter connections is joined to speed up transmissions. The technology also enables the network communication to continue if one of the adapters should be disconnected. Clustering refers to combining servers into a single unit, not network adapters.
116.    A network load balancing cluster is made up of multiple computers that function as a single entity. Which of the following terms is used to describe an individual computer in a load balancing cluster?

        1. Node
        2. Host
        3. Server
        4. Box

        Answer:

        B. In a network load balancing cluster, each computer is referred to as a host. Other types of clusters use other terms. For example, in a failover cluster, each computer is called a node. The terms _server_ and _box_ are not used in clustering.
117.    Which of the following is an element of high availability systems that enables them to automatically detect problems and react to them?

        1. Backups
        2. Snapshots
        3. Failover
        4. Cold sites

        Answer:

        C. Highly available systems often have redundant failover components that enable them to continue operating even after a failure of a router, switch, hard disk, server, or other component. Backups, snapshots, and cold sites can all contribute to a system's high availability, but they do not function automatically.
118.    Which of the following RAID levels does not provide fault tolerance?

        1. RAID 0
        2. RAID 1
        3. RAID 5
        4. RAID 10

        Answer:

        A. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a technology for storing data on multiple hard disk drives, providing fault tolerance, increased performance, or both. The various RAID levels provide different levels of functionality and have different hardware requirements. RAID 0 uses data striping only (blocks written to each disk in turn), which does not provide any form of fault tolerance. RAID 1 provides disk mirroring, RAID 5 combines disk striping with distributed storage of parity information, and RAID 10 creates mirrored stripe setsâ€”these three levels all provide fault tolerance.
119.    Which of the following networking concepts frequently use virtual Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide high availability? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Clustering
        2. Load balancing
        3. Network Address Translation (NAT)
        4. Network Interface Card (NIC) teaming

        Answer:

        A, B. A high availability virtual IP address implementation is when multiple servers are identified by a single address, enabling all of the servers to receive incoming client traffic. In the case of server clustering and network load balancing arrangements, the cluster itself has a unique name and IP address, separate from those of the individual servers. Clients address themselves to the cluster, not to one of the servers in the cluster. NAT is not a high availability technology, and NIC teaming does not use virtual IP addresses.
120.    Which of the following disaster recovery mechanisms can be made operational in the least amount of time?

        1. A cold site
        2. A warm site
        3. A hot site
        4. All of the options are the same.

        Answer:

        C. Cold, warm, and hot backup sites differ in the hardware and software they have installed. A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. It is therefore the least expensive and takes the most time. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware already installed, configured, and ready to go in the event of a disaster. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, and a hot site is the most expensive and takes the least amount of time to be made operational.
121.    Which of the following datacenter disaster recovery mechanisms is the least expensive to implement?

        1. A cold site
        2. A warm site
        3. A hot site
        4. A cloud site

        Answer:

        D. A cloud site is the least expensive to implement. Cold, warm, and hot backup sites differ in the hardware and software they have installed, but they all require the maintenance of a facility for a new datacenter. A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. It is therefore the least expensive of the cold, warm, and hot options and takes the most time. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware already installed, configured, and ready to go in the event of a disaster. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, and a hot site is the most expensive and takes the least amount of time to be made operational. A cloud site is a virtual facility maintained with a cloud service provider. The cloud site does not require physical space or physical hardware, so it is therefore the least expensive.
122.    Which of the following terms defines how long it will take to restore a server from backups if a complete system failure occurs?

        1. RPO
        2. RTO
        3. BCP
        4. MIB

        Answer:

        B. The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) specifies the amount of time needed to restore a server from the most recent backup if it should fail. This time interval depends on the amount of data involved and the speed of the backup medium. A Recovery Point Objective (RPO) specifies how much data is likely to be lost if a restore from backups should be necessary. This figure is based on the frequency of the backups and the amount of new data generated by the system. Business contingency planning (BCP) is an umbrella term for procedures enacted to keep the organization functioning in the event of a disaster. A Management Information Base (MIB) is a database used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) systems.
123.    In a disaster recovery scenario, which of the following terms applies to devices that are not repairable?

        1. MTBF
        2. MTTF
        3. MTTR
        4. MDT

        Answer:

        B. Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) refers to devices that will eventually fail once and then be discarded, rather than repaired. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and Mean Down Time (MDT) all refer to devices that will eventually fail and then be repaired and reused.
124.    If you have a server with dual power supplies, both of which are connected to a single Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), with a building power circuit connected to a backup generator, which of the following failures can the server survive and keep running indefinitely? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Failure of one server power supply
        2. Failure of the UPS
        3. Failure of the building power circuit
        4. Failure of the building backup generator

        Answer:

        A, D. If one of the server's power supplies fails, the other will continue to function. If the building's backup generator fails, the server will continue to run as long as the building still has outside power. If the UPS fails, the server will go down. If the breaker for the building power circuit trips, the server will run only as long as the UPS battery holds out.
125.    Which of the following is the primary function of an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) during a two-hour building power failure.

        1. To keep servers running until building power is restored
        2. To keep servers running until they can be powered down safely
        3. To keep servers from being damaged by power spikes
        4. To keep servers running in the event of a computer power supply failure

        Answer:

        B. UPSs can provide servers with battery backup power, but usually only for a few minutes, so that the servers can be powered down safely, without the potential for data corruption or loss. UPSs cannot keep servers running for two hours. UPSs can protect against power spikes, but that is not their primary function. A computer power supply failure will bring a server down, regardless of the presence of a UPS.
126.    If you have a server with dual power supplies, one of which is plugged into a single Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and the other into a wall socket with a surge protector, and the building's power circuit is connected to a backup generator, which of the following failures can the server survive and keep running indefinitely? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Failure of one server power supply
        2. Failure of the UPS
        3. Failure of the building power circuit
        4. Failure of the building backup generator

        Answer:

        A, B, D. If one of the server's power supplies fails, the other will continue to function. If the UPS fails, the server will continue to use the power supply plugged into the wall socket. If the building's backup generator fails, the server will continue to run as long as the building still has outside power. If the breaker for the building power circuit trips, the server will run only as long as the UPS battery holds out.
127.    If you have a server with dual power supplies, each of which is connected to a separate Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), with each UPS connected to a separate building power circuit connected to a backup generator, which of the following failures can the server survive and keep running indefinitely? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Failure of one server power supply
        2. Failure of one UPS
        3. Failure of one building power circuit
        4. Failure of the building backup generator

        Answer:

        A, B, C, D. If one of the server's power supplies fails, the other will continue to function. If one of the UPSs fails, the server will continue to run using the other. If one of the building power circuit breakers trips, the server will continue to run using the other one. If the building's backup generator fails, the server will continue to run as long as the building still has outside power.
128.    Which of the following is the criterion most commonly used to filter files for backup jobs?

        1. Filename
        2. File extension
        3. File attributes
        4. File size

        Answer:

        C. The archive bit that backup software uses to perform incremental and differential jobs is a file attribute, so this is the most commonly used filter type. It is possible to filter files based on their names, their extensions, and their size, but these are not used as often as the archive file attribute.
129.    Which of the following disaster recovery mechanisms is the least expensive to implement?

        1. A cold site
        2. A warm site
        3. A hot site
        4. All of the options cost the same.

        Answer:

        A. Cold, warm, and hot backup sites differ in the hardware and software they have installed. A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. It is therefore the least expensive. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware installed and configured. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, and a hot site is the most expensive.
130.    Which of the following statements about port aggregation is not true?

        1. All of the aggregated ports use the same MAC address.
        2. Port aggregation can be a fault tolerance mechanism.
        3. Aggregating ports increases network throughput.
        4. Port aggregation provides load balancing

        Answer:

        D. Load balancing refers to the distribution of traffic between two or more channels. Port aggregation combines ports into a single logical channel with a single Media Access Control (MAC) address and provides greater throughput. Port aggregation also provides fault tolerance in the event of a port failure.
131.    Which of the following can be provided by clustering servers?

        1. Fault tolerance
        2. Load balancing
        3. Failover
        4. All of the above

        Answer:

        D. A cluster is a group of computers configured with the same application that function as a single unit. The cluster can function as a fault tolerance mechanism by failing over from one server to the next, when necessary, or provide load balancing by distributing traffic among the servers.
132.    When you configure NIC teaming on a server with two network adapters in an active/passive configuration, which of the following services is provided?

        1. Load balancing
        2. Fault tolerance
        3. Server clustering
        4. Traffic shaping

        Answer:

        B. NIC teaming enables you to combine the functionality of two Network Interface Cards (NIC) in one connection. However, when you configure a NIC team to use an active/passive configuration, one of the network adapters remains idle and functions as a fault tolerance mechanism. If the other NIC should fail, the passive NIC becomes active. In this configuration, NIC teaming does not provide load balancing, server clustering, or traffic shaping.
133.    Which of the following is not a load balancing mechanism?

        1. NIC teaming
        2. Server clustering
        3. DNS round-robin
        4. RAID 1

        Answer:

        D. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) level 1 is a fault tolerance mechanism that is also known as disk mirroring. A storage subsystem writes data to two or more disks at the same time so that if a disk fails, the data remains available. Because data is written to the disks at the same time, this RAID level does not provide load balancing. NIC teaming balances a network traffic load among two or more Network Interface Cards (NICs), whereas server clustering and Domain Name Service (DNS) round-robin balance a traffic load among multiple servers.
134.    Which of the following best describes the difference between cold, warm, and hot backup sites?

        1. Whether the backup site is owned, borrowed, or rented
        2. The age of the most recent backup stored at the site
        3. The cost of the hardware used at the site
        4. The time needed to get the site up and running

        Answer:

        D. Cold, warm, and hot backup sites are a disaster recovery mechanism that enables a network to be activated at a remote location when a catastrophe occurs. The temperature refers to the sites readiness to assume the role of the network. A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. It takes less time to restore the network than at a cold site, but more than at a hot site. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware installed and configured. The network can go live as soon as the most recent data is restored.
135.    Which of the following specifications would you most want to examine when comparing hard disk models for your new Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) array?

        1. MTBF
        2. SLA
        3. AUP
        4. MTTR

        Answer:

        A. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) specifies how long you can expect a device to run before it malfunctions. For a hard disk, this specification indicates the life expectancy of the device. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) and an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) are not specifications associated with hard disk drives. Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) can conceivably be specified for a hard disk, but hard disk drives in a RAID array are typically replaced, not repaired.
136.    Which of the following RAID levels provides fault tolerance with the smallest amount of usable disk space? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. RAID 0
        2. RAID 1
        3. RAID 5
        4. RAID 10

        Answer:

        B, D. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a technology for storing data on multiple hard disk drives, providing fault tolerance, increased performance, or both. The various RAID levels provide different levels of functionality and have different hardware requirements. RAID 1 provides disk mirroring, and RAID 10 creates mirrored stripe sets. Both provide fault tolerance by maintaining two copies of every stored file, for a usable disk space percentage of 50 percent. Some mirroring configurations store more than two copies of each file, for even less usable space. RAID 0 provides data striping only, with no fault tolerance. RAID 5 combines disk striping (blocks written to each disk in turn) with distributed storage of parity information, for fault tolerance with a usable disk space percentage of at least 66 percent.
137.    Disk mirroring and disk duplexing are both fault tolerance mechanisms for hard disk data storage. Which of the following statements about disk mirroring and disk duplexing is true?

        1. Disk mirroring enables a server to survive the failure of a disk drive.
        2. Disk duplexing enables a server to survive the failure of a disk controller.
        3. Disk mirroring enables a server to survive a failure of a disk drive or a disk controller.
        4. Disk duplexing enables a server to survive a failure of a disk drive or a disk controller.

        Answer:

        D. Disk mirroring and disk duplexing both use multiple hard disk drives to store duplicate copies of all data. However, disk duplexing calls for each disk to be connected to a separate controller so that the data remains available despite a disk failure or a disk controller failure.
138.    You are installing a new Windows server with two hard disk drives in it, and you want to use RAID to create a fault-tolerant storage system. Which of the following RAID levels can you configure the server to use?

        1. RAID 0
        2. RAID 1
        3. RAID 5
        4. RAID 10

        Answer:

        B. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a technology for storing data on multiple hard disk drives, providing fault tolerance, increased performance, or both. The various RAID levels provide different levels of functionality and have different hardware requirements. RAID 1 provides disk mirroring for fault tolerance and requires two or more disk drives. RAID 0 provides data striping only, with no fault tolerance. RAID 5 combines disk striping (blocks written to each disk in turn) with distributed storage of parity information for fault tolerance, but it requires a minimum of three disk drives. RAID 10 creates mirrored stripe sets and requires at least four disk drives.
139.    Which of the following RAID levels provide fault tolerance without using parity data? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. RAID 0
        2. RAID 1
        3. RAID 5
        4. RAID 10

        Answer:

        B, D. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a technology for storing data on multiple hard disk drives, providing fault tolerance, increased performance, or both. The various RAID levels provide different levels of functionality and have different hardware requirements. RAID 1 and RAID 10 both use disk mirroring to provide fault tolerance, which does not require parity data. RAID 0 uses data striping only (blocks written to each disk in turn), which does not provide any form of fault tolerance. RAID 5 combines disk striping with distributed storage of parity information.
140.    Which of the following backup job types does not reset the archive bits of the files it backs up?

        1. Full
        2. Incremental
        3. Differential
        4. Supplemental

        Answer:

        C. Differential backups use the archive bit to determine which target files to back up. However, a differential backup does not reset the archive bit. Full backups do not pay attention to the archive bit, because they back up all of the files. A full backup, however, does clear the archive bit after the job is completed. Incremental backups also use the archive bit to determine which files have changed since the previous backup job. The primary difference between an incremental and a differential job, however, is that incremental backups clear the archive bit so that unchanged files are not backed up. There is no such thing as a supplemental backup job.
141.    What are the three elements in the Grandfather-Father-Son media rotation system for network backups?

        1. Hard disk drives, optical drives, and magnetic tape drives
        2. Incremental, differential, and full backup jobs
        3. Monthly, weekly, and daily backup jobs
        4. QIC, DAT, and DLT tape drives

        Answer:

        C. The generational media rotation system uses the terms _grandfather_, _father_, and _son_ to refer to backup jobs that are run monthly, weekly, and daily. The jobs can be full, incremental, or differential, and the terms have nothing to do with whether the backup medium is a hard disk, optical, or any type of tape drive.
142.    Which of the following types of backup jobs are supported by the Windows Server Backup program? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Incremental
        2. Differential
        3. Full
        4. Supplemental

        Answer:

        A, C. Windows Server Backup can perform full backups and incremental backups. It does not support differential backups, and there is no backup job called a supplemental.
143.    Which of the following is a term for a read-only copy of a data set made at a specific moment in time?

        1. Snapshot
        2. Incremental
        3. Hot site
        4. Differential

        Answer:

        A. A snapshot is a read-only copy of a data set taken at a specific moment in time. By creating a snapshot and then backing it up, you can be sure that no data corruption has occurred due to version skew. A hot site is an alternative network location in which all hardware and software is installed and ready. Incrementals and differentials are types of backup jobs.
144.    Which of the following storage techniques prevents version skew from occurring during a system backup?

        1. Incrementals
        2. Differentials
        3. Iterations
        4. Snapshots

        Answer:

        D. Version skew can occur when a data set changes while a system backup is running. A file written to a directory that has already been backed up will not appear on the backup media, even though the job might still be running. This can result in unprotected files, or worse, data corruption. A snapshot is a read-only copy of a data set taken at a specific moment in time. By creating a snapshot and then backing it up, you can be sure that no data corruption has occurred due to version skew. Incrementals and differentials are types of backup jobs, and iteration is not a specific storage technology.
145.    If you back up your network by performing a full backup every Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. and incremental backups in the evening of the other days of the week, how many jobs would be needed to completely restore a computer with a hard drive that failed on a Monday at noon?

        1. One
        2. Two
        3. Five
        4. Six

        Answer:

        C. An incremental backup is a job that backs up all of the files that have changed since the last backup of any kind. Therefore, to restore a system that failed on Monday at noon, you would have to restore the most recent full backup from the previous Wednesday and the incrementals from Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
146.    How does an autochanger increase the overall storage capacity of a backup solution?

        1. By compressing data before it is stored on the medium
        2. By automatically inserting media into and removing it from a drive
        3. By running a tape drive at half its normal speed
        4. By writing two tracks at once onto a magnetic tape

        Answer:

        B. An autochanger is a robotic device containing one or more removable media drives, such as magnetic tape or optical disk drives. The robotic mechanism inserts and removes media cartridges automatically so that a backup job can span multiple cartridges, increasing its overall capacity.
147.    For a complete restore of a computer that failed at noon on Tuesday, how many jobs would be needed if you performed full backups to tape at 6:00 a.m. every Wednesday and Saturday and incremental backups to tape at 6:00 a.m. every other day?

        1. One
        2. Two
        3. Three
        4. Four

        Answer:

        D. An incremental backup is a job that backs up all of the files that have changed since the last backup of any kind. Therefore, to restore a system that failed on Tuesday at noon, you would have to restore the most recent full backup from the previous Saturday and the incrementals from Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday morning.
148.    If you back up your network by performing a full backup every Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. and differential backups in the evening on the other six days of the week, how many jobs would be needed to completely restore a computer with a hard drive that failed on a Tuesday at noon?

        1. One
        2. Two
        3. Six
        4. Seven

        Answer:

        B. A differential backup is a job that backs up all the files that have changed since the last full backup. Therefore, to restore a system that failed on Tuesday at noon, you would have to restore the most recent full backup from the previous Wednesday and the most recent differential from Monday.
149.    Why does performing incremental backups to a hard drive, rather than a tape drive, make it possible to restore a server with a single job, rather than multiple jobs?

        1. Because hard drives hold more data than tape drives
        2. Because hard drives can transfer data faster than tape drives
        3. Because hard drives are random access devices and tape drives are not
        4. Because hard drives use a different block size than tape drives

        Answer:

        C. Data is stored on tape drives in a linear fashion. Once you write backup data to a tape, you cannot selectively replace individual files. When you perform a restore job, you might have to restore the most recent full backup, followed by incremental backups, which overwrites some of the full backup files with newer ones. Hard disk drives are random access devices, meaning that individual files can be written to and read from any location on the disk. When you perform incremental backup jobs to a hard disk, the software can restore data using any version of each file that is available. Data capacity, transfer speed, and block size are not relevant.
150.    Which of the following is not a fault tolerance mechanism?

        1. UPS
        2. RAID 1
        3. SNMP
        4. Clustering

        Answer:

        C. Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) is a means of tracking the performance and functionality of network components. Software or firmware components called agents are embedded in network devices and communicate with a central monitoring console. SNMP does not provide fault tolerance. An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is a battery backup device that enables a computer to continue functioning in the event of a power failure. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) level 1 is a disk mirroring mechanism that provides fault tolerance by maintaining duplicate copies of all stored data. Clustering is a mechanism by which multiple servers function as a single unit, running the same application, so that if a server should fail, the others continue to function.
151.    Which of the following is the primary difference between the Power Distribution Units (PDUs) used in datacenters and the standard power strips used in offices and homes?

        1. More outlets
        2. Larger power input
        3. Larger power output
        4. All of the above

        Answer:

        B. A PDU for a datacenter performs the same basic function as an office power strip, but it typically has a larger power input. It does not necessarily have more outlets or a larger power output.
152.    Which of the following statements about backing up a firewall's state and backing up its configuration are true? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. A backup of a firewall's state contains more data than a backup of its configuration.
        2. A backup of a firewall's configuration contains more data than a backup of its state.
        3. A backup of a firewall's state contains the exact same data as a backup of its configuration.
        4. A backup of a firewall's state includes its configuration.
        5. A backup of a firewall's configuration includes its state.

        Answer:

        A, D. A backup of a firewall's state includes its configuration as well as other elements, such as templates and policies. The state therefore contains more data than the configuration.
153.    Which of the following is the most commonly recommended fire suppression system for a datacenter?

        1. Carbon Dioxide
        2. Water
        3. Foam
        4. HFC-125

        Answer:

        D. Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 125 is a heat-absorbing gas that is frequently used for fire suppression systems. Many large datacenters include HFC-125 total flooding fire suppression systems because the products resulting from the flame retardation process are less toxic than carbon dioxide and do not damage electric and electronic equipment as water and foam do.
154.    Concurrent multipath routing (CMR) is a technique that provides which of the following benefits? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Increased bandwidth
        2. Fault tolerance
        3. Data encapsulation
        4. Load balancing

        Answer:

        A, B, D. CMR is a technique in which routers transmit data packets using multiple routes to the destination. This provides load balancing and improved performance by spreading the transmission among multiple paths and a measure of fault tolerance because a failure of one route only endangers part of the data. Data encapsulation is not involved in the CMR process.
155.    A First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) is designed to dynamically alter which one of the following Internet Protocol (IP) configuration settings on a network host?

        1. IP address
        2. Subnet mask
        3. Default gateway
        4. DNS server address

        Answer:

        C. FHRPs provide a fault tolerant default gateway for network hosts by automatically failing over to an alternative router address in the event of a router failure. Protocols such as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) create a virtual router that hosts use for their default gateway. The virtual router contains the addresses of multiple physical routers, to which it sends packets transmitted by the hosts. This provides fault tolerance in the event that a router fails, and in some cases provides load balancing as well. FHRPs do not affect the hosts' IP addresses, subnet masks, or DNS server addresses.
156.    Which of the following is not a First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)?

        1. CARP
        2. VRRP
        3. HSRP
        4. RARP

        Answer:

        D. FHRPs provide a fault tolerant default gateway for network hosts by automatically failing over to an alternative router address in the event of a router failure. The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is a deprecated Internet Protocol (IP) address assignment protocol; it is not an FHRP. Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) are all FHRPs.
157.    Ralph is designing a new network with the redundant switching arrangement shown in the accompanying figure. This redundancy enables every node on the network to communicate with any other node, even if one of the switches should fail. Which of the following is a potential drawback of this arrangement?

        Larger View

        <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713089107.3d40f2b6ad6609b2e2b85a64373a6494f4c71afd/eod/books/158796/images/c03uf005_0.jpg?width=821" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        1. Runt frames
        2. Late collisions
        3. Broadcast storms
        4. Corrupted switch lookup tables

        Answer:

        C. This redundant switch arrangement can result in broadcast storms, which are caused by packets being read by multiple switches as originating on different networks. The result is endless circulation of packets from switch to switch.
158.    Installing redundant firewalls in a parallel configuration, as shown in the accompanying graphic, provides which of the following benefits? (Choose all that apply.)

        Larger View

        <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713089107.3d40f2b6ad6609b2e2b85a64373a6494f4c71afd/eod/books/158796/images/c03uf006_0.jpg?width=821" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        1. Load balancing
        2. Fault tolerance
        3. Added security
        4. Enhanced performance

        Answer:

        A, B, D. Configuring the router to split incoming packets between the two firewalls provides load balancing and a resulting performance increase. If one firewall should fail, the parallel arrangement enables the other one to take over the processing of all incoming packets, providing fault tolerance. Two firewalls in parallel does not provide additional security.
159.    Redundant servers running in an active-active configuration provide which of the following advantages that the same servers in an active-passive configuration do not? (Choose all that apply.)

        1. Increased performance
        2. Fault tolerance
        3. Data encapsulation
        4. Load balancing

        Answer:

        A, D. In an active-active configuration, servers can balance the incoming client load between them. Because the active servers are all servicing clients, the overall performance of the cluster is increased. Both active-active and active-passive configurations provide fault tolerance. Data encapsulation is not a factor in either configuration.
160.    To build a network with redundant Internet connections that ensures full fault tolerance, it is necessary to use which of the following?
