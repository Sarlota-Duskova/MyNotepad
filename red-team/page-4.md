#### Cards

* MIFARE Classic - chip NXP, frequency 13,56 MHz
  * Is a series of integrated circuit (IC) chips used in contactless smart cards and proximity cards
  * AES and DES/Triple-DES encryption standards
    * AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S.
      * Is a variant of the Rijindael block cipher
      * For AES, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) -selected three members of the Rijindael family each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits
      * Symmetric-key algorithm - same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data
    * DES (Data Encryption Standard) - is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data, has 56-bit size key
* Proximity cards
  * Contactless card
  * The term proximity refers to the older 125 kHz devices as distinct from the newer 13,56 MHz
  * Read range of up to 50 cm, which is the main difference from the contactless smartcard with a range of 2 to 10 cm.



RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

* Uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.
* Uses in identification of animals
* Four categories of RFID:
  * Low Frequency at 125KHz RFID card
  * High Frequency at 13,56MHz RFID card
  * Ultra-High Frequency at 860-960MHz RFID card
  * Combination of two or even three different frequencies into a single RFID card
