#### Cards

* MIFARE Classic - chip NXP, frequency 13,56 MHz
  * Is a series of integrated circuit (IC) chips used in contactless smart cards and proximity cards
  * AES and DES/Triple-DES encryption standards
    * AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S.
      * Is a variant of the Rijindael block cipher
      * For AES, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) -selected three members of the Rijindael family each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits
      * Symmetric-key algorithm - same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data
    * DES (Data Encryption Standard) - is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data, has 56-bit size key
* Proximity cards
  * Contactless card
  * The term proximity refers to the older 125 kHz devices as distinct from the newer 13,56 MHz
  * Read range of up to 50 cm, which is the main difference from the contactless smartcard with a range of 2 to 10 cm.



RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

* Uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.
* Uses in identification of animals
*   Four categories of RFID:

    * Low Frequency at 125KHz RFID card
    * High Frequency at 13,56MHz RFID card
    * Ultra-High Frequency at 860-960MHz RFID card
    * Combination of two or even three different frequencies into a single RFID card


* **802.11a (WiFi 1)** – range 2,4 GHz, speed 2 Mbps
* **802.11b (WiFi 2)** – range 2,4 GHz, speed 11 Mbps, occasional use
* **802.11g (WiFi 3)** – range 2,4 GHz a 5 GHz, speed 54 Mbps
* **802.11n (WiFi 4)** – range 2,4 GHz a 5 GHz, theoretical speed 600 Mbps, real speed cca 150 Mbps.
* **802.11ac (WiFi 5)** – range 2,4 GHz a 5 GHz, it offers multiple channels, suitable for playing online games and streaming various videos
* **802.11ax (WiFi 6)** – the latest standard, range 2,4 GHz a 5 GHz, WPA3 security, extraordinary data transfer speed of up to 10 Gbps.

BTS (Base Transceiver Station) - contains the equipment for transmitting and receiving radio signals (transceivers), antennas, and equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications with the base station contro

* A BTS is controlled by a parent BSC via the "base station control function" (BCF) is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations. The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations.
* The BCF provides an operations and maintenance connection to the network management system (NMS) and manages operational states of each TRX, as well as software handling and alarm collection.

#### Wireless access point (AP)

* Is a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network.
* Standalone device the AP may have a wired connection to a router, but in a wireless router, it can also be integral component of the router itself.
