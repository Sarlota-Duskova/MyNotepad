# Questions

1.  A coworker is having problems with the Bluetooth connection between a device and their laptop. Which of the following can you do to check connectivity between the laptop and the device? (Choose two.)

    1. Ensure that Bluetooth is turned on in Settings.
    2. Ensure that Airplane mode is on.
    3. Ensure that Airplane mode is off.
    4. Go to a command prompt or terminal and type **Bluetooth** to enable it.

    Answer:

    A, C. Bluetooth must be turned on in settings before it will work. Airplane mode must be off for Bluetooth or any other wireless connection to work. Typing **Bluetooth** at a command prompt will not enable it.
2.  You just installed a new sound card in a Windows workstation. Now, the computer has crashed and given you a blue screen of death. You turn the computer off. What should you try to resolve the issue?

    1. Reinstall Windows.
    2. Boot to the Windows installation media and start the WinRE.
    3. Boot to safe mode and uninstall the sound card driver.
    4. Remove the sound card from the computer and reboot.

    Answer:

    C. The first thing to try when you get a blue/black screen of death (BSOD) error is to reboot. (In Windows 11, the blue screen has been replaced with a black one.) If the problem goes away, it may have been a one-time glitch. Often BSOD errors are caused by hardware or drivers, and since you just installed a new sound card and drivers in Windows, that would be the likely suspect. Use the WinRE to boot into safe mode by choosing Advanced Options ➢ Troubleshoot ➢ Advanced Options ➢ Startup Settings ➢ Enable Safe Mode. Once in safe mode, uninstall the driver and look for an updated one.
3.  An iPad user reports that when they are in a certain part of the building, their wireless connection intermittently drops. What are the two most likely causes of this? (Choose two.)

    1. Poor wireless buffering in the iPad
    2. Interference with the wireless signal
    3. Weak signal strength from the wireless access point
    4. Retracted Wi-Fi antenna on the iPad

    Answer:

    B, C. There are a number of reasons intermittent wireless connections can occur, but the two most common are lack of a good signal and interference. Increasing the number of wireless access points, or being closer to one, can address the lack of a good signal. Interference can be addressed by reducing the number of devices competing for the same channel or by moving away from walls or obstacles. A poor wireless signal can cause video buffering, not the other way around, and Wi-Fi antennas for mobile devices are often found inside the display housing, not a retractable antenna.
4.  A technician is troubleshooting a Windows 10 computer that is acting strangely, and they suspect that it's infected with a virus. They have followed the best practices for malware removal and remediated the computer. What should they do next?

    1. Schedule scans and run updates.
    2. Educate the end user.
    3. Enable System Restore and create a restore point.
    4. Disable System Restore in Windows.

    Answer:

    A. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
5.  A technician is working on a Windows 10 workstation that seems to be unstable. They want to ensure that system files have not been altered. Which command should they use to scan and fix corrupted system files?

    1. `sfc /scanfix`
    2. `sfc /scanfile`
    3. `sfc /verifyonly`
    4. `sfc /scannow`

    Answer:

    D. System File Checker (SFC) is a great tool for troubleshooting unstable systems. It scans for and corrects problems with protected system files. `Sfc /scannow` will check all system files and repair any problems it finds. `Sfc /scanfix` is not a valid command. `Sfc /scanfile` checks the integrity of the specified file only and will repair it. `Sfc /verifyonly` will check files but not repair problems that it finds.
6.  On your MacBook Pro, you use the Safari browser to surf the Internet. Yesterday a friend borrowed your laptop. Today, when you try to browse the web, no matter what site URL you type into the address bar, you are sent to a different website. What is most likely happening to your computer?

    1. A practical joke by your friend.
    2. Browser redirection.
    3. Rogue antivirus.
    4. It has been infected with spam.

    Answer:

    B. This is a classic symptom of browser redirection. The perpetrator has one goal, which is to direct you to websites that they want you to visit, regardless of what you actually want to see. Removing the redirector might be as simple as uninstalling an application (by dragging it to the Trash and emptying the Trash), or it might require full-scale virus (malware) mitigation.
7.  Your company purchases a custom database software package from an outside vendor. You install the client software on a Windows workstation, and it crashes when you try to open it. You remove the software and reinstall it, but again it crashes when you open it. What should you do next?

    1. Run an antivirus remediation on the workstation.
    2. Contact the vendor to see whether an update or patch is available.
    3. Delete and reinstall Windows.
    4. Enable Software Compatibility through Control Panel.

    Answer:

    B. When an application crashes, you want to isolate the cause of the crash. It could be a compatibility issue, hardware, or a host of other problems. Once it's isolated, you can solve the issue. One step to take early on is to look for updates, patches, or fixes to the application released by the vendor. It's not likely to be a virus issue because you just installed this application and haven't mentioned any virus symptoms. Deleting and reinstalling Windows is a drastic measure that would be your last-ditch effort. Compatibility settings can be found in the Properties menu of a program file.
8.  An iPhone user reports that his phone will not connect to his wireless headset for hands-free phone calls. His headset is powered on and has worked previously. His iPhone screen is shown here. What is most likely the problem?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c08g001_0.jpg" alt="" height="784" width="686"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. The headset is not paired with the iPhone.
    2. Bluetooth is turned off.
    3. Wi-Fi is turned off.
    4. Airplane mode is turned on.

    Answer:

    B. Lack of Bluetooth connectivity is often caused when a device is not turned on and/or has an improper setting for discoverability. Make sure the device is turned on and discoverable (checking the manufacturer's documentation if necessary).
9.  You are troubleshooting a Windows 11 workstation that could have malware on it. To follow the best practices for malware removal, what is the first step you should take?

    1. Quarantine the infected system.
    2. Update the anti-malware software.
    3. Enable system restore and create a restore point.
    4. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.

    Answer:

    D. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
10. A user reports that his Windows 10 Start menu looks wrong. You know the environment relies on roaming profiles. What is a reliable solution to the user's problem?

    1. Rebuild the desktop image.
    2. Rebuild the Windows user profile.
    3. Delete the Registry on the local machine.
    4. Reboot the machine.

    Answer:

    B. The solution to rebuild Windows profiles will fix the issue. Roaming profiles tend to experience problems, most of which can be reliably fixed by rebuilding the Windows profile.
11. While working on a Windows 11 workstation, a user receives a flashing pop-up message saying that their computer has been infected with a virus and they need to download a virus scanner now to fix it. What will most likely happen when they click the button to download the recommended virus scanner?

    1. It will download a virus to their computer.
    2. It will download an antivirus program to their computer and remediate the virus.
    3. The antivirus program they download will scan their computer and find nothing because their company already uses an antivirus program.
    4. It will take them to a website that will allow them to purchase an antivirus program to remediate the virus.

    Answer:

    A. One of the more clever ways of spreading a virus is to disguise it so that it looks like an antivirus program. When it alerts the user to a fictitious problem, the user then begins interacting with and allowing the rogue program to do all sorts of damage. One of the trickier things for troublemakers to do is to make the program look as if it came from a trusted source—such as Microsoft—and mimic the user interface enough to fool an unsuspecting user.
12. You have 20 Windows 11 workstations on your network. You want to create bootable media that will allow you to fix Windows boot issues. Where can you create this media?

    1. Use Windows Security in the Settings app.
    2. Back up and sync your settings in the Settings app.
    3. Download and use Microsoft's media creation tool.
    4. Copy the contents of the C drive to a USB.

    Answer:

    C. If you need installation media, search for and download the Windows media creation tool, which will enable you to create a bootable USB or DVD. Copying the contents of the C drive will not create installation media, and the drive won't be bootable. Windows Security in the Settings app will bring you to several security options, but none of them can create installation media; neither does backing up and syncing your settings.
13. Your Windows system doesn't appear to be stable. It's slow to respond when you want it to open a file. You just installed a new software application yesterday. What should you do to fix this problem?

    1. Reinstall Windows.
    2. Restore from a recent system restore point.
    3. Use the WinRE to reformat the drive.
    4. Remove the new drivers.

    Answer:

    B. Since you just installed a new application, chances are that it is the cause of any problems you're having now. A restore point will restore any system settings that may have been changed and may uninstall the software, but your data won't be affected. Reinstalling Windows is likely not necessary. You would not want to reformat the drive unless the system could not be repaired. Drivers are a type of software that is used to control hardware, so it's unlikely that installing a new application would install any drivers.
14. Your Windows system is running sluggishly. When you look at the hard drive, you notice that there is very little space available. Which tool should you run to attempt to free some space on the hard drive?

    1. Optimize and defragment drive
    2. Disk Cleanup
    3. `regedit`
    4. SFC

    Answer:

    B. If you save many large files, and the hard drive gets to be under 10 percent free space, its performance can slow down dramatically. The Disk Cleanup utility will show how much disk space is being taken up by temporary files, log files, the Recycle Bin, and other items that can easily be deleted. This could free up some disk space. You will possibly need to delete some files as well. Optimize and defragment drive will help with mechanical hard drives, but not solid-state drives. In fact, running it could damage a solid-state drive. Although it could help a sluggish system perform better, it doesn't free up space. The Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`) is a tool that should only be used when there isn't another utility that can do the same task. Improperly changing the registry could cause the operating system to crash. System File Checker (SFC) should be run if you're having problems related to system files; it won't free up space on your drive.
15. A user reports that a Word document they need will not open. Other documents open as they should. They have not made a backup of this file. Which of the following statements is true?

    1. The file is probably corrupted, and its contents are lost.
    2. They can use a restore point to get the file back.
    3. They can use the command-line utility to open the document.
    4. They can use WinRE to repair the file and then open it.

    Answer:

    A. Sadly, if the user hasn't backed up this file, it is likely lost. A restore point backs up system configuration, not user files. If a file won't open in the GUI (graphical user interface), it probably won't open at a command prompt either. The WinRE can fix problems with the system booting or restore the entire machine from an image, but if the files aren't on the image, then WinRE can't restore or open the file either.
16. You've been working very hard and have several Word documents open on your desktop. Luckily, you've been saving them often because suddenly the Word app is showing all sorts of strange characters on the screen, even in the ribbon at top. It appears to be corrupted and it won't respond to any commands, including Close. How can you force the app to close so you can reopen the saved files and continue your work? (Choose two.)

    1. Double-click the program file.
    2. Right-click anywhere in the program window and choose Close.
    3. Open Task Manager and select the Processes tab. Then right-click the program name and choose End task.
    4. Reboot the computer.

    Answer:

    C, D. Rebooting the computer should close the app and clear anything out of RAM, but you may be able to solve the problem with less drastic measures by ending the process using Task Manager. Double-clicking the program file and right-clicking in the window won't help because the program is corrupted and not responding.
17. Your iPad is experiencing slow performance. What are the best two options to increase performance speed? (Choose two.)

    1. Close open apps.
    2. Perform a reset to the factory default.
    3. Increase the RAM.
    4. Perform a soft reset.

    Answer:

    A, D. Slow performance is often related to RAM. Look for any apps that are running and can be closed or perform a soft reset (cycle power off and on again) to try to free up memory. Resetting to the factory default will delete all data on the device. You can't upgrade the RAM in an iPad.
18. You just downloaded an app for your bank on your mobile device. You weren't sure which app to choose, so you picked the one that looks most like your bank. After installing the app something just didn't look right and you noticed misspelled words on the screen where it's asking for your username and password. What should you do next?

    1. Enter your username and password.
    2. Call the bank and ask them about the app.
    3. Uninstall the app immediately and run a virus scan.
    4. Run spell check on the app.

    Answer:

    C. Most likely this is a malicious application that is trying to steal your login information. Misspellings are a red flag that the application is an attempt by a malicious person to spoof your bank's app. Uninstall the app immediately and run a virus scan to ensure that nothing malicious was loaded on your system when you downloaded the app. Whatever you do, don't enter your username and password! You could call the bank and let them know about the app. Running spell check on the app wouldn't help you or even be possible on the app.
19. You are visiting a website using your favorite browser, and without you clicking anything, a new browser window opens in front of it with an advertisement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?

    1. Your computer has been infected with adware.
    2. Your computer has been infected with spyware.
    3. Your computer has been infected with a virus.
    4. The website is programmed to show a pop-up advertisement.

    Answer:

    D. Pop-ups are annoying but not necessarily an indication that your computer is infected with anything. Most likely, the website is programmed to show a pop-up advertisement. Adware pop-ups usually spam your desktop with multiple (if not dozens of) windows at the same time. Spyware generally doesn't announce its presence, and viruses generally do more damage than a simple pop-up ad does.
20. You are talking to a friend about purchasing a gift, and they recommend a website to purchase it. When you put the website's secure address into your browser, you receive a message stating that there is an invalid certificate. What should you do?

    1. Visit the website anyway; it's probably OK.
    2. Do not visit the website.
    3. Visit the secure version of the website by changing the address to start with `HTTPS://`.
    4. Visit the unsecure version of the website by changing the address to start with `HTTP://`.

    Answer:

    B. An invalid certificate usually means that the certificate that you have (or the one the website has) has expired. It could mean that the site is fine. But it could also mean someone has set up a Trojan that imitates the site you are seeking. Do not visit the website. If it's a site you are not familiar with, the best bet is to avoid it altogether.
21. You are training technicians on the creation and use of restore points. Restore points can sometimes fix problems with slow or unresponsive systems. Which of the following is not a way in which restore points are created?

    1. Windows creates them automatically by default.
    2. You can manually create them.
    3. Windows creates them before a system crash.
    4. Some installation utilities will create them before installing a new program.

    Answer:

    C. It's unlikely that Windows would be able to predict when a system crash is about to happen, so it isn't going to create a restore point. There are, however, common activities that can present a risk to a system, such as installing new hardware drivers or new applications. In those instances, Windows will create a restore point before the software or hardware driver is installed. A system restore point is also created by default once a week, and you can manually create them whenever you would like.
22. You are troubleshooting a workstation on your network and believe it has malware. To follow the best practices for malware removal, after you investigate and verify malware symptoms, which step should you take?

    1. Update the anti-malware software.
    2. Disable System Restore.
    3. Quarantine the infected system.
    4. Scan for and remove the malware.

    Answer:

    C. You don't want an infected system to infect others on your network! The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
23. Your favorite restaurant locator app on your iPhone won't load. You closed it and tried to reopen it a few times and it still doesn't work. What should you try next?

    1. Remove and reinstall the app.
    2. Perform a factory reset.
    3. Force-stop the app.
    4. Reboot the phone and try the app again.

    Answer:

    D. Rebooting (powering off and back on) any device will clear what is in its memory and sometimes help with application problems, so try rebooting the phone and try the app again. If that doesn't work, you may want to remove and reload the app. Be sure to check the vendor's website for any known problems. You would not want to do a factory reset for a problem with one app because that would delete everything on your phone. Performing a force-stop on the app would close it if it were open, but in this scenario, we can't load the app.
24. You are using an iPhone. When is it generally necessary to close running apps on the iPhone?

    1. When you receive out-of-memory errors
    2. When the phone is sluggish
    3. When an app locks up
    4. When you are done using them for the day

    Answer:

    C. If an app on your smartphone is locked up, then you need to force-close the app, which is done on an iPhone by swiping the app up. Apps running in the background of an iPhone aren't really running or using resources, unless you've set them up to refresh in the background. (Android apps aren't as good at this.) You likely won't get an “out of memory” error message, but you may run out of storage space. If your phone is sluggish, it's likely that the battery is low or you're running out of storage space. You don't need to close apps when you're done with them for the day. If they're in the background, they aren't using resources.
25. You receive an email warning you of a new form of ransomware. It contains a link to receive more information on how to protect yourself from this terrible threat. What should you do next?

    1. Click the link to receive more information.
    2. Check [`www.us-cert.gov`](http://www.us-cert.gov/) for information on the threat.
    3. Check to ensure that your system has a rogue antivirus installed.
    4. Forward the email to everyone in your contacts list.

    Answer:

    B. The email could be real, but most likely it's a hoax. Worse yet, it could be malware itself, and by clicking the link you will activate it on your computer. Always check a reputable source, such as [`www.us-cert.gov`](http://www.us-cert.gov/), [`www.cert.org`](http://www.cert.org/), or an anti-malware vendor for information on the latest threats. At a minimum, delete the email and don't click the link!
26. Mobile device users on your network are required to use a VPN app to connect to the corporate network when they are out of the office. A user reports that the app will not open for them. They turned the tablet off and back on again, and the app still will not open. What should be tried next?

    1. Cycle the power.
    2. Reset to factory defaults.
    3. Uninstall and reinstall the app.
    4. Perform a force-stop.

    Answer:

    C. If an app does not load, the first thing to try is rebooting. If that does not work, attempt to uninstall and reinstall the app. Be sure to check the vendor's site for any similar problems (and solutions) encountered by others. Cycling the power is turning the device off and on again. The user has already done that. A reset to factory defaults wipes the phone. That would be the last remedy you would try for repairing a phone problem. A force-stop is merely closing the app, which you can't do because it won't open.
27. A network user with an Android tablet wants to back up and synchronize their data with their phone. Which service should they use to perform these tasks?

    1. Google Sync
    2. Google Cloud
    3. Android Sync
    4. Android Cloud

    Answer:

    A. Because problems tend to happen no matter how careful you may be, it is important to back up devices and be able to restore from those backups after an incident. Google Sync is available for backups and synchronization of data between Android-based devices and PCs that have a Microsoft Exchange account. Google Cloud is their IaaS (infrastructure as a service) platform. Android Sync and Android Cloud are not real services.
28. A client has a Windows 11 computer with a virus on it. They have quarantined the system from the rest of their network. To follow malware removal best practices, what should be done next?

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    3. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    4. Update anti-malware software.

    Answer:

    B. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
29. Your Windows desktop system is running sluggishly. You have a magnetic hard drive and an M.2 drive. What could you do that might improve system performance? (Choose two.)

    1. Run Optimize and defragment drive on the magnetic media drive.
    2. Run Disk Cleanup on both drives.
    3. Run Optimize and defragment drive on the M.2 drive.
    4. Run SFC.

    Answer:

    A, B. If you save many large files, and the hard drive gets to be under 10 percent free space, its performance can slow down dramatically. The Disk Cleanup utility will show how much disk space is being taken up by temporary files, log files, the Recycle Bin, and other items that can easily be deleted. This could free up some disk space. Optimize and defragment drive will help with mechanical hard drives, but not solid-state drives. In fact, running it could damage a solid-state drive like your M.2. As you access and change files on a drive, the parts of the drive can end up scattered in different places. With a mechanical drive, retrieving the file will be faster if the file's pieces are all next to each other on the drive. Defragmenting the drive rearranges it and puts each file's scattered pieces together. System File Checker (SFC) should be run if you're having problems related to system files. It won't free up space on your drive.
30. You are visiting a website using your favorite browser. You haven't clicked anything, yet you can barely read the page because there are so many pop-ups. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?

    1. Your computer has been infected with adware.
    2. Your computer has been infected with spyware.
    3. Your computer has been infected with a virus.
    4. The website is programmed to show a pop-up advertisement.

    Answer:

    A. Adware pop-ups usually spam your desktop with multiple (if not dozens of) windows at the same time. Spyware generally doesn't announce its presence, and viruses generally do more damage than a simple pop-up ad does. A website may have legitimate pop-up ads, but they won't have so many that it sends you to another website.
31. On your network, you are concerned about mobile users accidentally granting unauthorized account access or root access. What step should you take to help prevent these security problems?

    1. Apply patches and upgrades as soon as they are available.
    2. Monitor resource utilization and remediate high usage.
    3. Install mobile firewalls on all devices.
    4. Disable location tracking, the camera, and the microphone.

    Answer:

    A. Security holes in mobile device operating systems can leave back doors into which users can get unauthorized account or root access. The majority of these holes are closed by patches and upgrades as soon as they are discovered, so be sure to keep operating systems current. Monitoring usage should be part of system maintenance as sudden, unexplained high usage could be caused by malware. A firewall wouldn't help in this situation, and disabling location tracking, the camera, and microphone would make the phone useless.
32. Client computers on your network connect to the Internet through a proxy server. Recently, a Windows client was infected with adware and a browser redirector. You have removed the malware, and now the computer will not connect to the Internet. What should you do to resolve the problem?

    1. Disable the network card. Reboot and enable the network card.
    2. Perform malware remediation again.
    3. Disable the proxy server configuration to connect directly to the Internet.
    4. Check the IP configuration to ensure it's pointing to the correct proxy server address.

    Answer:

    D. Malware can change more settings than you might be aware of on a computer. For example, adware might be obvious because of the pop-ups and browser redirects, but it can also change the client-side IP settings that point to a DNS or proxy server. Check the IP configuration on the client and be sure it's set properly.
33. A technician just updated the network card driver for a Windows workstation. Now, the network card does not appear to work. They reboot the computer and log back in, and it still does not work. What should be done next to resolve the issue?

    1. Reboot into safe mode and uninstall the network card driver.
    2. Reinstall Windows.
    3. Open Device Manager, find the network card, and roll back the driver.
    4. Replace the malfunctioning network card.

    Answer:

    C. Since you just updated the driver, it's most likely that the driver is the problem. Go to Device Manager (`devmgmt.msc`), find the network card and roll back the driver to the previous one, then reboot the system. It's not necessary to uninstall the card driver. It's highly unlikely that the card is malfunctioning. The problem is the driver the technician just installed.
34. Your company has recently made changes to infrastructure services such as DNS. The new DNS information is available but not yet propagated to all workstations. Since then, a number of users have reported that they are no longer able to browse for internal servers. What should each affected user do? (Choose two.)

    1. Reboot.
    2. Manually update network settings.
    3. Disable software firewall.
    4. Boot to safe mode.

    Answer:

    A, B. Updating the network settings manually or rebooting should apply the new DNS information. Disabling the firewall or booting to safe mode will not help the issue.
35. Your Windows PC is acting poorly after you installed a few poorly written applications. Now the system will not function properly. You want to refresh your Windows installation but keep your personal files. Where can this be done from? (Choose two.)

    1. System Recovery Options
    2. Safe mode
    3. Emergency repair disk
    4. WinRE

    Answer:

    B, D. There are options for entering safe mode. If you're able to use the OS, then go to Settings and search for advanced startup, then choose Change advanced startup options, and under Advanced startup, click Restart now. This will restart the computer and bring up the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). Alternately, hold the Shift key while restarting the computer. This will also cause the PC to boot into the WinRE. To access safe mode, choose Troubleshoot ➢ Advanced options ➢ Startup Settings ➢ Safe Mode.
36. Your system has become infected with malware. You verified the symptoms, quarantined the system, and disabled System Restore. Now you need to eradicate the virus. What would be a good choice to do next? (Choose two.)

    1. Boot into safe mode to clean out virus files.
    2. Boot Windows as normal.
    3. Rebuild the registry.
    4. Use installation media to boot into the preinstallation environment.

    Answer:

    A, D. Step 4 of the best practice procedures for malware removal is to remediate the infected systems. While the exact steps depend a bit on the malware and the damage done, it's easier to get rid of the malware files if you don't boot to the drive the malware is on. You could boot into safe mode, which is a limited operating system, and run an antivirus, or boot with installation media from a completely separate drive and run an antivirus on your hard drive, or boot from a bootable USB drive that was made using tools from your favorite antivirus company and run its antivirus/anti-malware eradication tools. In any case, you will want to ensure that you've downloaded the most current malware definition files available to scan and remove the threat.
37. A Windows user's antivirus software has crashed. They reboot the computer and try to open it again, and it crashes again. What should be done next to solve the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. Look for a patch or update on the manufacturer's website.
    2. Delete the antivirus software and reinstall it.
    3. Remove and reinstall Windows.
    4. Repair the antivirus installation through Programs and features in Control Panel.

    Answer:

    A, D. When an application crashes, you want to isolate the cause of the crash—it could be a compatibility issue, hardware, or a host of other problems—and solve it. One step to take early on is to look for updates/patches/fixes to the application released by the vendor. You can also try to repair the installation through Control Panel. If needed, you can delete and reinstall the software, but you should try patching or repairing first. You would not want to remove and reinstall Windows.
38. A user reports that an application has been crashing on their mobile device. They said an error pop-up window flashes on the screen briefly, but they are unable to read it. What would be your next step?

    1. Wait for the next crash to read the error pop-up yourself.
    2. Install and run a screen recorder to capture the next pop-up.
    3. Reinstall the application.
    4. Check the application log for error messages.

    Answer:

    D. Whatever message was appearing in the pop-up window is likely in the mobile application log. If it was too fast for the user to read, it's probably too fast for you to read too. You would not want to install any additional software until this problem is resolved, and reinstalling the application may not be necessary.
39. A user reports that the battery life on their smartphone is very short. It works for only about three hours before it needs to be recharged. What can you recommend they do to extend the battery life? (Choose two.)

    1. Turn off unnecessary wireless connections.
    2. Perform a reset to factory defaults.
    3. Set the screen to automatically dim.
    4. Install an antivirus app.

    Answer:

    A, C. Tips for increasing battery life include keeping OS updates applied (they may include energy-saving patches), avoiding ambient temperatures that are too high or too low, letting the screen automatically dim, and turning off location-based services. You should also disconnect peripherals and quit applications not in use (Bluetooth, for example, uses power when enabled, even if you are not using it to connect to anything). A reset to factory defaults won't help with battery life, and you'll lose all your stuff! Installing an antivirus app also won't help here.
40. A user is unable to access the network and is getting an error message that a duplicate IP exists on the system. You are confused because you have a DHCP server. What do you need to do next?

    1. Manually configure the IP address.
    2. Ensure that this computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically.
    3. Ping the IP address from another computer to find out the name of the duplicate computer.
    4. At a command prompt, enter `ipconfig /release`, then `ipconfig /renew`.

    Answer:

    B. Every device on a network must have a unique IP address. Many networks use a DHCP server to assign IP addresses because keeping track of them manually would create a great deal of work. If there are two identical IP addresses attempting to access a network with DHCP, then at least one of them has its IP address configured manually. Ensuring that this computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically should be your first step. If it isn't, then you have found the problem. If it is, then you could ping the IP address using `ping -a` _`ipaddress`_, substituting the duplicated IP address for the variable _`ipaddress`_ in the command. This will return the hostname of the other computer. Every network admin should have a list of computer names and where they are located. You could then ensure that the other computer is also set to obtain an IP address automatically. Manually configuring an IP address is what caused the problem. The `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew` commands wouldn't help in this situation.
41. A user reports the printer was working fine yesterday but is no longer. Last night, they updated their printer drivers assuming they should always have the most up-to-date drivers installed. What is the likely fix for this problem?

    1. Roll back the printer driver.
    2. Update the boot order.
    3. Update the network settings.
    4. Restart the print spooler.

    Answer:

    A. Given the description, it might be best to roll back the printer driver to a known good version. Updating the boot order and network settings have no impact on the printer working. Stopping and restarting the print spooler is not likely to help, since the driver was just updated. But if rolling back the device driver doesn't help, the problem might be related to a print job in the queue; then restarting the print spooler could be a next step.
42. You have just purchased an Android mobile phone and are concerned about security threats. Which of the following statements is true?

    1. There are no viruses for Android-based mobile phones.
    2. Android-based phones come with an automatically enabled antivirus app.
    3. You should download and install an antivirus app.
    4. As long as you automatically install OS patches, you will not get an Android virus.

    Answer:

    C. Android, the mobile device operating system, is open source, which means that it is very flexible and, unfortunately, just as vulnerable to malware as any other operating system, maybe even more because of being open source. The Android operating system does have several built-in security features such as passwords, two-step verification, and Google Play Protect, which scans for malware daily and attempts to remove malicious apps before they are downloaded. Unfortunately, malware can come from other sources such as email, so it's important to install a reliable antivirus/anti-malware for Android devices. Android does not have a built-in antivirus app. Keeping the OS patches installed will help plug any security vulnerabilities, but it isn't enough.
43. You are working on your Windows computer and a security alert pops up, as shown here. What should your next action be?

    Larger View

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c08g002_0.jpg?width=821" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Click the Protect Now button.
    2. Click the X in the upper-right corner to close the alert.
    3. Shut down your computer. Reboot, and initiate a virus scan using your antivirus software.
    4. Use System Restore to create a snapshot and then click the Protect Now button.

    Answer:

    C. Don't click anywhere on the warning! This is either a hoax or when you click on the pop-up, it will install malware. Even clicking the X to close the window may install malware, so don't do it. Your best course of action is to shut down the computer, reboot, and initiate a virus scan using your antivirus software.
44. You have a Windows workstation that is spontaneously shutting down and restarting. What should you do to troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

    1. Check the system BIOS/UEFI settings to ensure that the boot order is set properly.
    2. Boot to the Windows installation media and navigate to the WinRE command prompt.
    3. Boot into safe mode and see if the problem still persists.
    4. Reinstall Windows.

    Answer:

    C. Occasionally, a rogue system will begin automatically shutting down and/or restarting while in use. Although it could be indicative of a hardware problem (a malfunctioning motherboard, for example), it can also indicate a setting misconfiguration or driver problem. The most likely setting problem is with sleep settings, such as hibernation mode. If that's not it, then it could be a corrupted driver. To begin ruling out possibilities, boot the system into safe mode and see whether the problem continues. If the problem does not occur while in safe mode, then boot normally and begin testing what occurs as you eliminate drivers/devices one by one (sound, video, and so forth) until you find the culprit. The boot order in the BIOS/UEFI settings would have nothing to do with this problem. While you may need to go into WinRE to fix the problem, that would not be your next step. You certainly don't need to reinstall Windows, at least not yet.
45. A Windows desktop computer always shuts down about 10 minutes after the user boots it up. The computer works fine for those first 10 minutes, and if they boot up again a few minutes after a shutdown, it works fine again for 10 minutes. How might you fix this? (Choose two.)

    1. Reinstall Windows.
    2. Use compressed air or an ESD vacuum to clean dust and debris from the system.
    3. Use SFC to search for and repair corrupted system files.
    4. Replace the thermal paste on the processor.

    Answer:

    B, D. Although it may appear to be a problem with the operating system, this is classic behavior for a system that is overheating. There are a few things to do here. Ensure that all vents on the system are free of dust and debris so that air can move freely through. Use compressed air or an antistatic computer vacuum to remove dust from inside the case. Dust on a motherboard can act as a blanket holding heat in, or worse, it can cause a short and damage the motherboard. Make sure there is adequate room around the case for airflow; if the system is overclocked, revert to running the CPU at its manufacturer's recommended speed. If none of those remedy the situation, try replacing the processor's thermal paste with new thermal paste. Reinstalling Windows or checking system files is not necessary.
46. Your Windows computer was working fine yesterday, but today it is exhibiting slow performance. Which of the following tools should be used to check for a potential problem causing the slowdown? (Choose two.)

    1. Anti-malware software
    2. Event Viewer
    3. Task Manager ➢ Processes tab
    4. Programs and Features in Control Panel

    Answer:

    A, C. If the computer was fine yesterday and slow today, your first thought should be that it may have been attacked by malware. Malware running in the background is notorious for taking up system resources. Your first course of action should be to follow the malware removal process. If malware is not found on your system, look next at the Processes tab of Task Manager. Click Memory at the top to sort the list by how much memory each program is using. It may be software launched at startup that you don't need or another program that doesn't need to run all the time. Based on what you find there, take appropriate action.
47. A user on your Active Directory domain is complaining that their profile is taking a long time to load. They've been waiting several minutes. Upon questioning, you find out that this is their first logon at a different computer. What is happening here?

    1. They are not listed as a user on this computer.
    2. Their roaming profile is downloading to this computer, and it takes longer the first time a user logs onto a different PC.
    3. A peripheral is not connected as it should be, causing a loop in the boot process.
    4. They entered the wrong password.

    Answer:

    B. Active Directory stores user information on the domain, including their profile. The first time a user logs onto a machine on the domain, the entire profile is downloaded, which may take a few minutes. For subsequent logons on the same machine, only the changes to the profile are downloaded, making the process much faster. If the user then logs into a different machine, the entire profile must be downloaded, so the logon won't be as fast as the user is accustomed to. They don't need to be listed as a user on this computer as long as they are a user on the Active Directory. A peripheral being connected or not should not affect the profile download, and entering the wrong password would quickly generate an error message stating that.
48. A Windows user at your office receives the message in the graphic when trying to print a document. They know that there were two printers listed yesterday. What is likely the problem?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c08g003_0.jpg?width=821" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Someone has deleted their printers.
    2. Both of the printers are offline.
    3. Both printers are out of paper.
    4. The print spooler service needs to be restarted.

    Answer:

    D. When the Print Spooler service is not running, a user will not be able to see or print to any of their devices. Open the Services console and restart the Print Spooler to remedy the situation. If the printers were offline or out of paper, most likely the printer would send a message stating such to the user's screen.
49. The time on your Windows computer is always off by a few minutes to an hour. You need to ensure that it will keep the right time because an incorrect time will not allow it to log into your server. Which of the following actions will not help?

    1. In Settings, select Time & Language, then Date & time, and ensure that Set Time Automatically and Set Time Zone Automatically are set to On.
    2. Right-click on the time on the taskbar and choose Internet Time, then choose a different time server.
    3. Open the Services console and ensure that the Windows Time service start is set to Automatic and that the service is started.
    4. In Settings, select Time & Language, then Date & time, and click Sync now.

    Answer:

    B. Occasionally the time on a computer is off because of errors in settings in Windows or a domain controller. In Windows 10 and 11, the time settings are accessed in the same way. If the time is off by exactly an hour, or exactly several hours, then most likely the time zone is set manually and incorrectly. If it's off by minutes, then it's something else causing it, but you can sync the time now and correct the settings using the Date & time options on the Time & Language tab in the Settings app. On an Active Directory domain, the domain controller uses the Windows Time service and Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize the time of all the computers on the domain, so it's important to ensure that the Window Time service is running. Option B is not available in Windows 10 or 11.
50. A Windows 10 workstation that is set to boot from the C: drive, and normally boots just fine, will not boot properly. Instead, there is an error message stating that no OS is found. What steps could you take to fix this problem?

    1. Boot to installation media, navigate to a command prompt, type **startup repair**, and press Enter.
    2. Boot to the installation media, open SFC, and choose Startup Repair.
    3. Boot to the installation media, then choose Repair your computer ➢ Troubleshoot ➢ Startup Repair and follow the onscreen prompts.
    4. Boot to Safe Mode ➢ System Recovery Options ➢ Startup Repair and follow the onscreen prompts.

    Answer:

    C. If the operating system is missing, it could be due to a bad or corrupted boot sector on the hard drive, or the operating system may indeed be missing. Your first step would be to ensure that the boot files are not corrupted. To do this, boot to the installation media (you may have to set your BIOS/UEFI to boot to the installation media drive), then choose ➢ Next ➢ Repair your computer ➢ Troubleshoot ➢ Startup Repair and follow the onscreen prompts. Typing **startup repair** at a command prompt returns an error message. SFC (System File Checker) is used to verify OS files, not a program you can open and choose something in, and you wouldn't be able to boot into safe mode because the computer thinks the operating system is missing. You may be thinking it could be nonbootable media in a drive, but the question states that the computer is set to boot from the C: drive.
51. A Windows workstation is running slowly. You have already verified that there is no malware in the system. What will you check next? (Choose two.)

    1. Check available physical memory.
    2. Check available virtual memory.
    3. Roll back the OS update to a prior one.
    4. Restore from a restore point.

    Answer:

    A, B. There are many reasons why a system would be running slowly. If it suddenly starts running slowly, suspect that malware might be involved and perform the malware removal process. If no malware is found, check physical and virtual memory. You may need to increase the physical RAM or change virtual memory settings. It could also be that a RAM module has failed or needs to be reseated. Other possibilities are a full hard drive (which rarely happens with today's huge hard drives) or a problem with hardware. Ensuring that the operating system is up-to-date is always a good idea. You would not roll back to a prior update, and restoring from a restore point would not necessarily help here.
52. An application on your Windows workstation isn't working properly and when you research the error message online, the result is that you need to update the application. Where can you go to do this? (Choose two.)

    1. Check for an update option in the software.
    2. In Control Panel, click Programs and Features.
    3. Check the application's website.
    4. In the Settings app, select Apps, then Apps & features.

    Answer:

    A, C. The first place to look for updates would be an option on the application's menu. If nothing is found there, check the application's website. Programs and Features in Control Panel and Apps & features in the Settings app have options to uninstall, change, or repair, but not update, applications.
53. You're trying to launch an application on your Windows workstation, but the application won't load. You've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the application, but it didn't help. Which of the following should you do next?

    1. Check the application's website for updates.
    2. Verify that your system meets the application requirements.
    3. Choose a different application that does the same thing.
    4. Reinstall Windows.

    Answer:

    B. With all due respect, you should have verified that your system meets the application's minimum requirements before you even purchased or downloaded it. Remember, too, that you'll need enough RAM for all the programs that are running at the same time. If your operating system is newer than the application's required operating system, you could check the manufacturer's website for an update, but that would happen after you compare your system to the application's requirements. You certainly would not reinstall Windows because an application won't start, and although you could find a different application that meets your needs, that's not the best solution here.
54. You're in Microsoft Word and want to open a file that you used yesterday. You know that you saved the file, and it shows in the list of recently used files, but when you click on it a message says that the file can't be found. You go the folder where the file is stored and see that the file extension has been changed. What should you immediately suspect?

    1. The drive is corrupted and you need to reinstall Windows.
    2. The Word program is corrupted and you need to reinstall Word.
    3. A coworker has been playing with your computer and opened and saved your file using a different program.
    4. Your computer has been infected by malware.

    Answer:

    D. Your first thought in this situation should be that there is malware on your computer. You would perform the procedures for malware removal immediately. It's unlikely that you would need to reinstall the Word program or Windows, and while it's possible that someone has been playing tricks on you, that's not the most likely reason, unless that someone is the person who wrote the malware.
55. A Windows computer user receives an error message that a needed service failed to start. Where can that user go to start the service? (Choose two.)

    1. Services tab of Task Manager
    2. Computer Management
    3. The Services console
    4. Device Manager

    Answer:

    A, C. All services can be found in the Services console (`services.msc`). A subset of those can be found on the Services tab of Task Manager. If the needed service isn't there, a link at the bottom of the page will take you to the full list of services. Computer Management does not have a link to the Services console, and Device Manager is intended for managing hardware and drivers.
56. A Windows system is running slowly. Which of the following is not likely to be the culprit?

    1. The PC has too little RAM.
    2. The paging file is too large.
    3. The system is infected with malware.
    4. The hard drive is too large.

    Answer:

    D. The first concern when a system is running too slowly is that there may be malware. Once you've verified that there isn't any malware, if the system is still running slowly, check the page file size. The page file is the file that holds virtual memory. Virtual memory is using a part of a hard drive as if it were RAM. A larger paging file may alleviate low memory warnings, but the price is slower performance because the hard drive is slower than RAM. To change the amount of hard drive space reserved for virtual memory, search for advanced system settings, and select View advanced system settings. On the System Properties window click the Advanced tab then in the Performance box, click Settings. In the Performance Options window, choose the Advanced tab, and in the Virtual memory box, click the Change button. Deselect Automatically manage paging file size for all drives, then click Custom size. Adjust the size by typing the appropriate value in the Initial size (MB) box and Maximum size (MB) box. Then click Set. If you have a magnetic hard drive (HDD) and a solid-state drive (SSD), the SSD will be faster, but using it for virtual memory can shorten its life. If possible, it's better to increase the physical RAM than virtual memory. A hard drive being too large would not cause this problem.
57. You are trying to apply Windows Updates to a Windows client computer. The update fails and gives you an error message. What should you do next?

    1. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter in the Settings app.
    2. Wait until the next Windows update comes out in 6 months.
    3. Reinstall the operating system.
    4. Purchase an updated computer.

    Answer:

    A. In Windows 10 and 11, if the update fails to work properly, run the Windows Update Troubleshooter in the Settings app. The troubleshooter will search for and attempt to resolve any problems that may prevent updates to your operating system. When it has finished, check for updates again. You may need to run the troubleshooter more than once. It's important that the operating system is kept up-to-date because updates may be patching security holes in the system. You would not want to reinstall the system because eventually you would need to install the same update, and most likely you would not need to purchase an updated computer.
58. A technician is fixing a Windows workstation that has contracted a virus. They are following the best practices for malware removal and have enabled System Restore and created a restore point. What is the next step that should be taken?

    1. Educate the end user.
    2. Disable System Restore.
    3. Quarantine the infected system.
    4. Remediate the infected system.

    Answer:

    A. An educated end user who is aware of the signs of malware is one of the best protections against malware. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
59. You work for a government entity and they insist that you use the government time server, [`time.NIST.gov`](http://time.nist.gov/), to sync the time on your computer system. Where will you go to do this?

    1. In the Settings app, select Time & Language, then Date & time, and ensure that Set time automatically and Set time zone automatically are set to On.
    2. Open the Services console and ensure that the Windows Time is set to [`time.NIST.gov`](http://time.nist.gov/) and that the service is started.
    3. In Control Panel, select Date and Time, and on the Internet Time tab, click Change settings, then under Server, choose [`time.NIST.gov`](http://time.nist.gov/).
    4. Double-click the time in the task bar and on the Internet time tab under servers, choose [`time.NIST.gov`](http://time.nist.gov/).

    Answer:

    C. You can choose the time server to sync with by going to Control Panel, selecting Date and Time, and on the Internet Time tab, clicking Change settings, then the down arrow on the right of the entry box, and choosing the correct server in the Server box. The Date and Time options will allow you to change settings for time zone and set time automatically, but not which server you are using. In the Services app, you can choose how and if the Windows Time service runs, but again, not the time server that is being used.
60. A Windows user complains that every day they get a message that a service they need for a particular program is not started, and they must open the Services console and start it every day. What will you tell the user?

    1. Some services behave that way. You'll need to start it every day.
    2. Open the Services console, double-click the service, and on the General tab, change the startup type to Automatic.
    3. Open the Services console, double-click the service, and on the General tab, change the startup type to Manual.
    4. Open the application and look for a place to have it start the service for the user.

    Answer:

    B. Services will behave as you tell them to. Services can be set to Automatic so that they'll start automatically when the computer starts, or to Automatic (Delayed Start) so that the computer will start faster. They still start when the computer starts up, just two minutes later. Manual start is what the user is currently doing. Starting of the service would be set up in the Services console, not the application. A service can also be triggered to start by some event or other software, then closed again when it is no longer needed.
61. You've noticed that lately your games freeze or crash more often, and you received a message stating that your computer is low on memory. What can you do to resolve this? (Choose two.)

    1. Increase virtual memory.
    2. Decrease virtual memory.
    3. Increase physical memory.
    4. Buy a bigger hard drive.

    Answer:

    A, C. When you're getting messages that your computer is low on memory, you can stop some programs that are running in memory, but more likely you will need to increase physical memory and/or virtual memory. A rule of thumb is that virtual memory should be 1.5 times the physical memory, but you can make the setting larger if you wish. The downside of using more virtual memory instead of physical memory is that virtual memory resides in a page file (`pagefile.sys`) on the hard drive, and hard drives are slower than RAM, so having a larger swap file may slow the system performance. To change virtual memory, search for advanced system settings, and select View advanced system settings. On the System Properties window click the Advanced tab then in the Performance box, click Settings. Click the Advanced tab, and on the Performance Options window, in the Virtual memory box, click the Change button. Deselect Automatically manage paging file size for all drives, then click Custom size, and adjust the size by typing the appropriate value in the Initial size (MB) box and Maximum size (MB) box. Then click Set.
62. An application you want to install says that it needs 4 GB of RAM. Where will you go to see if you have sufficient RAM to run this application? (Choose two.)

    1. Open the case and see how many modules are installed.
    2. Use the System Information utility.
    3. Use the Performance tab in Task Manager.
    4. In Control Panel, select Memory.

    Answer:

    B, C. There are several places in the operating system where you can see how much physical RAM is installed in the system. Opening the case and counting the modules is neither necessary nor an accurate measure of how much RAM you have. The System Information utility (`msinfo32.exe`) has this and much more information about your computer. The Performance tab in Task Manager will not only show you how much physical memory you have, but it will also show you how much is being used. This can give you a better idea of whether you have enough RAM installed because it is also taking into consideration what is normally being used in your system. Another place you can see installed RAM, not shown in the options for this question, is Settings ➢ System ➢ About. There is no Memory utility in Control Panel.
63. A user reports the PC was fine until an OS update was installed. Believing that all updates are necessary, the user voluntarily updated the system on their own. However, the update was not yet tested and is found to be incompatible with a needed business application. What is your next step?

    1. Roll back the update.
    2. Update the business application.
    3. Do nothing; have the user take awareness training.
    4. Kill the updated task.

    Answer:

    A. Given the description, it might be best to roll back the update. Until the business application and update can be proven compatible, the update cannot be installed as is. Killing the task is not acceptable as it may be a necessary task, such as `explorer.exe`.
64. You are troubleshooting a Windows workstation that has contracted a virus. According to the best practices for malware removal, which two steps are part of remediating the infected system? (Choose two.)

    1. Disable system restore in Windows.
    2. Schedule scans and run updates.
    3. Update anti-malware software.
    4. Scan for and remove the malware.

    Answer:

    C, D. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine Infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
65. While booting up a Windows PC, you find it takes a long time at the Welcome screen. The message “Your roaming profile isn't synchronized with the server…” appears. Which two of the following are true? (Choose two.)

    1. The User Profile service detected a slow connection.
    2. A locally cached profile was loaded.
    3. User Profile Service is not running.
    4. Screen resolution is not compatible with the user profile.

    Answer:

    A, B. The Windows User Profile service detects when there is a slow link between the client computer and the domain controller. The service will then load the user's profile from a copy that is cached on the local machine. If the user has used a different machine since the last time they used the current one, then the profile changes will not be on the local machine. The User Profile service is running, because it is what generates the error message. Screen resolution has nothing to do with this error message.
66. You just installed new external speakers on a Windows computer, and you've received an error message saying, “Not enough USB Controller Resources.” What would most likely be causing this error? (Choose two.)

    1. The motherboard is damaged.
    2. USB devices are drawing more power than the limit.
    3. There are too many devices on a USB 3.0 hub controller.
    4. The speaker drivers are conflicting with the USB hub controller drivers.

    Answer:

    B, C. USB ports provide limited power to the devices connected to them. If that power is exceeded, one or more the devices attached to the controller may stop working and the error message “Not enough USB Controller Resources” may be generated. They also have a limited number of endpoints available on each port. Some devices use more endpoints than others and if the limit is exceeded, the same error message will be generated. A damaged motherboard could cause many things to malfunction but likely would not generate this error message, and it is highly unlikely that the speaker drivers would conflict with the USB hub controller drivers.
67. A smartphone user has complained that their phone won't let them look at anything in landscape—no matter how they turn it, it will not automatically rotate. You look at their screen and it appears as in the graphic. Why isn't their phone letting them look at pictures in landscape view?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c08g004_0.jpg" alt="" height="868" width="557"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Their Bluetooth is off.
    2. Their focus is off.
    3. Their camera is not on.
    4. Their orientation is locked.

    Answer:

    D. On the graphic, the third icon down on the left, just above Focus, is the screen orientation. Notice that the lock is closed. That means that their smartphone orientation is locked in portrait mode and will not autorotate. Bluetooth, focus, and the camera have nothing to do with this problem.
68. Mobile device users on your network report that the network has very slow data speeds. Which of the following are likely contributors to this problem? (Choose two.)

    1. Low battery life
    2. Signal interference
    3. Unintended Wi-Fi connections
    4. Weak signal

    Answer:

    B, D. Slow data speeds can be caused by too much interference or by a weak signal. If there is too much interference, try changing the channel on Wi-Fi routers to less used channels; performance should increase. Solve weak signals by installing more access points or signal boosters, or by moving closer to an existing access point, or away from physical obstructions.
69. Several mobile device users have reported that when they eat lunch in the garden next to the office building, they have limited Internet connectivity. What is the most likely fix for this?

    1. Boost WAP signal strength.
    2. Have all the users reboot their devices.
    3. Reboot the WAP.
    4. Have the users turn on Wi-Fi on each of their devices.

    Answer:

    C. A limited connectivity error means that your device is able to connect to Wi-Fi but not to the Internet. The fact that this is happening with several users in the same area likely means that it is a problem with the wireless access point (WAP), not an individual device. The users are getting a limited connectivity error, so they're connecting to the WAP but not getting an IP address from the DHCP server or router. Try cycling the WAP off and back on to resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, troubleshoot the connection between the WAP and the router. You don't need to boost the signal strength because the users are able to connect to the WAP. Having all the users reboot their devices will not solve the issue, and if they're getting a limited connectivity message, then Wi-Fi on their device is already turned on.
70. You've been looking for a specific Android app and found it at an amazing price. It almost seems too good to be true, which makes you pause to consider whether it is the real app or not. Which of the following should you check before paying for and downloading this app? (Choose three.)

    1. Check the reviews and number of reviews.
    2. Check the developer's name and how long the app has been available.
    3. Verify the spelling of the app name.
    4. Install the free version and see if there are any problems.

    Answer:

    A, B, C. There are many bootleg, imitation/fake, and malicious apps waiting for unsuspecting users to download them. They often have names very similar to the actual app, but there are ways to identify the spoofed apps. First, check the reviews. If you see negative comments about problems with mobile devices after installing the app, beware. Look at the number of downloads or reviews. If it's a popular app it will have a high number of both. For example, if you see a Hulu app with less than a million reviews, it is not the real app. Research the app and the company it comes from. Check the spelling of not only the app name, but the description and the screenshots as well. Misspelled words are a sign that the app is not legitimate. How long has the app been available? Popular apps will not have been released three days ago. If there is a free version, don't download it and install it without doing your due diligence first. Offering something for free is a way to get you to download it and install something malicious. If you download an app and it asks for permissions that you don't think it should need, be suspicious.
71. A user on your network complains that they see a message for a long time that says “Waiting for the User Profile service” and their profile is very slow to load. What could be the problem?

    1. There is a slow link between the domain controller and the client, but it was not correctly detected by the User Profile service.
    2. The user has never logged into this computer before.
    3. Windows needs to be updated.
    4. The user entered an invalid password.

    Answer:

    A. This message happens when the User Profile service incorrectly identifies the connection between the client and server as a fast connection, when it is actually slow. These settings can be configured on the domain controller. If the User Profile service detects a slow connection, it will load a cached profile from the local machine instead of the roaming profile on the server. If it's the first time the user has logged into a particular machine, then the profile will take longer to load because the entire profile is loaded, not just the changes, but it wouldn't generate this error message. It is unlikely that a failure to update Windows would affect this message, and if a user entered an invalid password, they would see a message stating that.
72. You're working on a Windows client and have received an error message saying, “Not enough USB Controller Resources.” Which of the following is not a possible remedy for this situation?

    1. Plug a USB cable from a power block into one of the USB ports on the motherboard.
    2. Purchase an external hub or docking station that is separately powered and plug devices into it.
    3. Move devices that don't need USB 3.X speed to USB 2.0 ports.
    4. Disable the XHCI Mode option in the BIOS/UEFI settings.

    Answer:

    A. Plugging a USB cable from a power block into a port of the motherboard will not solve your problem, and it will likely destroy your motherboard. The first thing you should try is rearranging the devices that are using the USB ports. USB hubs have a limit as to how much power they can provide and the number of endpoints that each port can support. A device may have multiple endpoints, and devices that are heavily involved in data transfer may use many more endpoints than other devices. Using an external hub or docking station that is separately powered means that the port won't be providing power to the devices, so this may resolve the issue. Disabling the XHCI Mode option in the BIOS/UEFI may help with the resource error but will effectively turn off USB 3.0 and your hubs will behave like 2.0 ports. Other troubleshooting options could be to update the chipset drivers for the motherboard and check the power options in the BIOS/UEFI. Make sure any USB controller drivers are updated. If you have plugged and unplugged devices, try going to Device Manager to scan for hardware changes and test devices again. Also in Device Manager, uninstall all USB controllers and restart the computer. Windows will scan for hardware changes and all the USB controllers that were uninstalled should be reinstalled, which will allow the USB controllers to return an unresponsive port to a working condition.
73. Your friend has complained that they can't connect their phone to their Wi-Fi network at home and they've used all their cellular data. You look at their screen and it appears as in the graphic. What is the problem?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c08g005_0.jpg" alt="" height="812" width="518"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Airplane mode is on.
    2. Their Bluetooth is turned off.
    3. Their Wi-Fi is turned off.
    4. Their cellular service is turned off.

    Answer:

    C. Either Airplane mode being on or Wi-Fi turned off would keep them from connecting to their Wi-Fi, but in this case, according to the graphic, the Wi-Fi is turned off. Cellular service and Bluetooth should have no effect on their ability to connect to their home Wi-Fi network.
74. You're using the most recent version of Microsoft Edge to browse the Internet on your Windows workstation. Today when you visit any website, you receive an error message that there is an invalid certificate. It happens regardless of the site you visit. What should you do?

    1. Check your computer's time and date.
    2. Refresh your certificate through the Security settings in Control Panel.
    3. Set your security level to low for the Internet Zone in Internet Properties in Control Panel.
    4. In Microsoft Edge, turn off Enhance Your Security On The Web.

    Answer:

    A. If your computer is set to an incorrect time and date (we're talking years off, not just a few minutes), then it can cause invalid certificate errors for the websites you want to visit. Refreshing your certificate is not an option in the Security settings in Control Panel, and there is no low option for the Internet zone in Internet Properties. It's never recommended to turn off your security settings for browsing the Internet.
75. You use an iPad and an iPhone at work. Which of the following represents the greatest threats to leaking personal files or data? (Choose two.)

    1. Unauthorized root access
    2. Unintended Wi-Fi connections
    3. Unauthorized location tracking
    4. High resource utilization

    Answer:

    A, B. When authorized users access devices through unintended connections or unauthorized users access absconded devices (such as with root access), they can access the data on the device. Every firm should have a policy for protecting data (encryption) and dealing with leaks when they occur.
76. You receive a notice from your wireless provider that you are about to exceed your data transmission limit for the month. What type of risk does this present?

    1. Your account may be deactivated.
    2. You may incur a security breach.
    3. You may have to pay high fees.
    4. Your phone may be locked out of the system.

    Answer:

    C. Going over the limit on your phone's data plan is generally not a major risk, other than to your finances. Data overage charges can be high, depending on your provider and service plan. It is unlikely that your account will be deactivated, made more vulnerable to security breaches, or locked out of the cellular system.
77. Your Android-based phone has recently started rebooting randomly. Which of the following might be the cause? (Choose two.)

    1. A poorly written app.
    2. Battery is at room temperature.
    3. Auto-restart is enabled.
    4. Typing too fast on the keyboard.

    Answer:

    A, C. The most likely cause for an Android phone randomly restarting is a poorly written app. Any apps that you're not using should be deleted from the device. Another cause may be that on some Android phones, there is an auto-restart feature as a part of a Device Care option to boost phone performance. If it is on, turn the feature off to avoid automatic restarts. Batteries that are too hot or too cold can cause problems, but room temperature batteries are just right. Typing too fast on the keyboard wouldn't cause a reboot problem. Other problems not listed might be the battery overheating or third-party cases that don't fit just right (causing a button to stick), defective hardware, or corrupted operating system files.
78. A smartphone user calls to report that their phone has no wireless connectivity. What is the first thing you should tell them to do?

    1. Turn the phone off and back on again.
    2. Check whether Airplane mode is on.
    3. Perform a reset to factory default.
    4. Adjust the Wi-Fi signal receptivity.

    Answer:

    B. A common cause for lack of wireless connectivity is that the device is in Airplane mode. Ensure that the device is not in that mode, then cycle the power if necessary. If the problem persists, you'll need to perform further troubleshooting. There is no Wi-Fi receptivity setting, and you would not reset the device to factory default without exhausting all other options first.
79. You are troubleshooting a Windows system that was infected with malware. You've worked through all of the best practice procedures for malware removal up to and including scheduling scans and running updates. What do you need to do next?

    1. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    2. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    3. Remediate infected systems.
    4. Educate the end user.

    Answer:

    A. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
80. Your network has several dozen mobile device users. Several of them have reported that there are areas within your office where network access is very slow. What can you use to test wireless access?

    1. Cell tower analyzer
    2. Wi-Fi analyzer
    3. Hot spot analyzer
    4. Data transmission analyzer

    Answer:

    B. A Wi-Fi analyzer can be used on your network to see signal strength, channels used, and various other network metrics. Any company with a wireless network should have one for troubleshooting purposes. A Wi-Fi analyzer could be as simple as an app on your phone, to a very sophisticated and expensive device.
81. A user on your network is suddenly receiving an overwhelming number of pop-up ads on their mobile device. What is likely happening?

    1. They contracted a virus.
    2. They were the victim of shoulder surfing.
    3. They are the victim of an adware attack.
    4. They are the victim of a keylogger attack.

    Answer:

    C. The specific behavior exhibited most likely means that their device is the victim of an adware attack. Adware tracks your movements and targets you with advertisements, trying to get you to click on them and spend your money. Viruses move from one machine to another by some casual contact such as sending an email. Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering where someone literally looks over your shoulder to try to gain classified information like your login and password. A keylogger records keystrokes and sends them back to a third party. They would try to hide their presence rather than announce it.
82. An Android phone user just received a new Bluetooth headset for phone calls. They've reported that it does not work with their phone. Both devices are powered on and appear to be operational. What is most likely the problem?

    1. Bluetooth is turned off on the Android device.
    2. Bluetooth is turned off on the mobile headset.
    3. The devices need to be paired.
    4. Airplane mode is on.

    Answer:

    C. If the Bluetooth devices have not been used together previously, they need to be paired to work. Pairing is usually a simple process. CompTIA's steps to configure Bluetooth devices are:

    1. Enable Bluetooth.
    2. Enable pairing.
    3. Find a device for pairing.
    4. Enter the appropriate PIN code.
    5. Test connectivity.
83. You have an unlimited data plan with your cellular provider, but today you receive a notice from your provider that you are about to exceed your data transmission threshold for the month. What will likely happen?

    1. Your account may be deactivated.
    2. You may incur a security breach.
    3. Your data transmissions will be slower than normal.
    4. Your phone may be locked out of the system.

    Answer:

    C. Even most unlimited plans aren't truly unlimited. Most mobile or even home Internet providers will slow down your transmission rate when you exceed a specified data threshold. It is highly unlikely that your account will be deactivated, become vulnerable to security breaches, or be locked out.
84. A user complains that their Apple device is randomly restarting. They haven't installed any new software recently. What steps will you take to troubleshoot the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. Ensure that the iOS or iPadOS and apps are up-to-date.
    2. Check your battery health in Settings ➢Battery➢ Battery Health.
    3. Replace the battery.
    4. Reset the phone to factory default.

    Answer:

    A, B. According to [`Apple.com`](http://apple.com/), if everything is up-to-date and your battery is healthy but the problem continues, you need to contact Apple Support. Most batteries are not user replaceable. Be sure to back up your data before contacting Apple Support, and if you reset the phone to the factory default, you will lose everything on the phone. This also isn't Apple's recommendation.
85. A very serious looking pop-up appears on your mobile device screen and says to click it for an update to your anti-malware software that will eradicate a virus your device has contracted. Which of the following should you not do?

    1. Click the link to update your anti-malware.
    2. Restart the device in safe mode if that is an option on your device.
    3. Update your anti-malware as you normally do and run a scan.
    4. Check online for information about this fake security warning.

    Answer:

    A. This is a typical fake security warning. If you click the message, or anywhere on the message, it will likely install the malware that it is mentioning. To ensure that your device is clean, update your anti-malware software and run a scan. It's important to keep your OS and all software updated with the latest versions. Use a reliable anti-malware software, strong passwords, or a password manager; avoid using public Wi-Fi (just because it says it's Starbucks Wi-Fi doesn't necessarily mean that it is); and do your due diligence when choosing new apps to download and install, even from places like the Google Play app.
86. A smartphone user is concerned about their privacy and wants to ensure that others can't hack into their phone and track down their location or access their personal data and pictures. Which of the following actions will provide them with some protection to help prevent this from happening? (Choose two.)

    1. Install an anti-malware app.
    2. Install OS updates as soon as they are available.
    3. Disable Location Services.
    4. Enable sync with a cloud provider.

    Answer:

    A, B. Smartphones are susceptible to malware, just like any other computer device. Some malware can be configured to perform unauthorized location tracking. To help prevent this, always patch and update the OS as soon as updates are available and install anti-malware software. Some services such as maps require that location services be enabled, but if the user chooses to, Location Services can be disabled. Exactly how to do that depends on the device, but the option is most likely in the Settings menu. Enabling sync with a cloud provider will make a backup of their data, but it does nothing to protect it from being leaked.
87. A step in the malware removal best practices is to manually create a restore point in Windows. What will the restore point do?

    1. Create a copy of the entire hard drive.
    2. Create a copy of the `Users` folder and system configuration data.
    3. Create a copy of system configuration data.
    4. Create a bootable media with copies of key system files.

    Answer:

    C. A restore point is a copy, or snapshot, of your system configuration at a given point in time. It's like a backup of your configuration but not your data. Snapshots are created within Windows by clicking the search icon, typing **Create A Restore Point**, and selecting it from the list of results. The System Properties window opens. It should open on the System Protection tab. If not, click the System Protection tab, and near the bottom of the screen is a Create button next to Create a restore point right now for the drives that have system protection turned on. Clicking the Create button begins the process of creating a restore point.
88. You're trying to pay for coffee at your favorite shop using their NFC reader and Apple Pay, but your phone isn't communicating with it. What could be the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. Wi-Fi is disabled.
    2. NFC isn't enabled.
    3. Airplane mode is on.
    4. Bluetooth is disabled.

    Answer:

    B, C. To use NFC services like Apple Pay and Google Pay, you need to ensure that Airplane mode is off and NFC is enabled. For Apple devices, go to Settings, then Control Center, and click the green plus sign next to NFC Tag Reader. For Android devices, download the Google Pay app, launch it, and follow the onscreen instructions. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have no effect on the NFC reader.
89. You're attempting to share files with an iPad user by using AirDrop. You both have Wi-Fi turned on, but you can't seem to connect. Which of the following could be causing the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. One of you does not have Bluetooth turned on.
    2. You are not listed in their contacts.
    3. They have their AirDrop Receiving setting set to Everyone.
    4. They turned off their hotspot.

    Answer:

    A, B. For AirDrop to work, you must both have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, and you need to be within Wi-Fi and Bluetooth range. If either party has a hotspot on, it must be turned off. If you are not in the receiver's contact list and they have their AirDrop Receiving setting set to Contacts Only, then you will not be able to send them information. If you are in their contacts list, then your Apple ID email or your phone number must be in the contact card. If they change their AirDrop Receiving setting to Everyone, then they can receive the file even if you are not in their contacts list.
90. A mobile device user on your network is suddenly receiving an overwhelming number of pop-up ads on their mobile device. Immediately you're concerned that they've been infected with spyware. While performing the best practices for malware removal, what should be installed on their device to mitigate this threat?

    1. Antivirus software
    2. Anti-malware software
    3. A firewall
    4. A proxy server

    Answer:

    B. There are many other forms of malware in addition to viruses. While a true antivirus program will scan for viruses, anti-malware programs are a superset of virus scanners and will look for more than just traditional viruses. They can scan for spyware, ransomware, adware, and other malicious programs as well. Firewalls and proxy servers can be used to mitigate attacks as well, but they likely won't be installed on the mobile device. The seven steps of the malware removal process are as follows:

    1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms.
    2. Quarantine infected systems.
    3. Disable System Restore in Windows.
    4. Remediate infected systems.
       1. Update anti-malware software.
       2. Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., safe mode, preinstallation environment).
    5. Schedule scans and run updates.
    6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.
    7. Educate the end user.
91. You're attempting to update the iOS on your iPhone, but the update fails and you receive the message, “Unable to install update. Software update requires a network connection.” What should you do first?

    1. Retry the update using the same network connection.
    2. Connect the iPhone to your PC and update it that way.
    3. Remove apps or data to make enough room on your phone for the update.
    4. Plug an Ethernet card into your iPhone.

    Answer:

    A. If the update fails once because of a lost or insufficient network connection, retry the update using the same network connection. If it fails again, connect the iPhone to your computer to perform the update. This error message has nothing to do with insufficient room on your iPhone, and there is no Ethernet card for an iPhone.
92. An application failed to update on a user's phone. Which of the following are likely to be the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. The phone is plugged into power.
    2. There is insufficient space on the phone.
    3. You're using Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet.
    4. The Internet connection is weak.

    Answer:

    B, D. Regardless of the OS, if there is insufficient space on a smartphone or a weak Internet connection, an application is unlikely to update. Allowing the power to go too low or the device to turn off during an update may cause problems, so it's perfectly fine to have the phone plugged in while doing updates. Generally speaking, mobile devices use Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet, and you will want a strong Wi-Fi signal.
93. A user reports that their mobile phone has been experiencing high resource utilization for about a week. What two things should you immediately suspect could be causing the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. Unauthorized root access
    2. Failing battery
    3. Excessive number of open apps
    4. Stuck sync operation

    Answer:

    A, C. High resource utilization can be a telltale sign that a device is running more than you think it should be—perhaps the drives are being searched or the camera is recording your every move. Or, it could be that the user has too many apps open and the device is struggling with available resources. The latter tends to happen more on Android smartphones than iPhones.
94. You are visiting a customer's office in a large city high-rise building. You need to make a call on your mobile phone, but you have only one bar. The call will not complete. What should you do?

    1. Wait a few minutes and try again.
    2. Cycle the power off and on.
    3. Reset to factory defaults.
    4. Step outside or near a window.

    Answer:

    D. Weak signals are a common culprit behind dropped signals. Before you engage in communication, signal strength on the device should be evaluated. If the signal is low (for example, no bars), then change location (step outside, drive out of the tunnel, exit the elevator, and so forth) and try for a better signal. A low battery can affect signal strength, so keep the battery charged as much as possible. Waiting a few minutes won't help if something is blocking the signal. And cycling the power off and on probably won't help either. You certainly wouldn't reset your phone to factory defaults any time that your signal was weak!
95. The GPS app on your mobile phone keeps popping up randomly on the screen, and your phone seems to be running very slowly. Which choice will likely not help in this situation?

    1. Restart the phone in safe mode.
    2. Force-stop the application.
    3. Perform a malware scan.
    4. Uninstall the app.

    Answer:

    B. You don't need to force-stop the application because it isn't unresponsive. What you should do is suspect that your phone is infected with malware. Most Android phones have a method to restart in safe mode. Once there, perform a malware scan and uninstall the offending app. Make sure your OS and other apps are updated. If you identify any other suspicious apps (apps that are acting strangely), then they may have been infected as well and should be removed and a clean copy downloaded and installed.
96. While driving through the remote countryside, you notice that your mobile phone battery has been quickly drained of power. What is the most likely cause of this?

    1. The battery needs to be replaced.
    2. The phone has been searching for a signal.
    3. You need to cycle the power off and on again.
    4. You need to replace the phone.

    Answer:

    B. While apps, usage, and so on can contribute to power drain, one of the biggest offenders is the search for a cellular signal. It's unlikely that the battery needs to be replaced, power cycled off and on, or the phone replaced. Simply recharge the battery.
97. A user wants to use developer mode on their Android device to make some tweaks to the system. What setting will you tell them they should not leave on? (Choose two.)

    1. USB configuration
    2. Show Touches
    3. Developer mode
    4. Debugging

    Answer:

    C, D. If developer mode and the debugging feature are left on, then whenever the PC is connected to any computer, the Android device is essentially wide open, meaning that passwords, bank accounts, photos and so on are visible to anyone who accesses it. There are many features that can be manipulated in debugging mode, such as Show Touches, Pointer Location, Transition Animation Scale, and so on. Just ensure that developer mode and debugging are turned off when you are done with them.
98. You're attempting to share pictures with a friend using Apple's AirDrop. You both have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on. Neither of you is using your phone as a hotspot. They have you in their contacts list and their AirDrop Receiving setting is set to Contacts Only, yet you still can't share files with them. Which of the following could be causing the problem? (Choose two.)

    1. You are set to receive from Everyone.
    2. Your contact card on their phone doesn't have your Apple ID email or phone number.
    3. You are not within Bluetooth range of each other.
    4. They turned off their hotspot.

    Answer:

    B, C. For AirDrop to work, you must both have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled. You need to be within Wi-Fi and Bluetooth range. If either party has a hotspot on, it must be turned off. If you are not in the receiver's contact list and they have their AirDrop set to receive from contacts only, then you will not be able to send them information. If you are in their contacts list, then your Apple ID email or your phone number must be in the contact card. If they change their AirDrop Receiving setting to Everyone, then they can receive the file even if you are not in their contacts list.
99. You're trying to update your iPhone's iOS, but there is not enough free space on your phone to do the update. Which of the following should you do? (Choose two.)

    1. Use your computer to perform the update.
    2. Remove content and apps that you don't use.
    3. Purchase more internal memory for your iPhone.
    4. Purchase an SD card for your iPhone.

    Answer:

    A, B. To update the iOS, you need to have sufficient room on your iPhone. You may be able to use your computer to do the update since files can be temporarily stored on the computer by the update while it is working. If it still won't update using your computer, then you need to make space on your iPhone by removing apps or data that you aren't using. Adding internal storage to an iPhone is not possible, and while it is possible to use an adapter and an SD card for extra storage, an SD card can't be used to hold the iOS.
100.    You're trying to install an update to Google Chrome on your Android mobile device, but the update isn't working. Which of the following might be the problem? (Choose two.)

        1. The Play Store cache is empty.
        2. The network speed is too fast.
        3. The date and time on your device is wrong.
        4. There are other downloads or updates pending in the Play Store queue.

        Answer:

        C, D. The Play Store won't install updates or apps if your date or time is incorrect, so ensure that they are correct. Google Chrome won't update if there are other updates pending in the queue, so you'll need to cancel those updates to allow Chrome to update. Clearing the Chrome cache will free up space on your device. Other circumstances that you need for application updates in general are a good Wi-Fi connection, sufficient space on your device, and if the app is unresponsive, you need to force-close it before installing an update.
101.    A user is complaining that they see a lot of ads popping up on their screen in the bottom right (the notifications area). They have run a scan using their anti-malware software and it says their computer is clean. The constant pop-ups are interfering with their work, and they ask you what can be done about it. Which of the following is not true?

        1. These are push notifications, not pop-ups.
        2. Nothing can be done about them.
        3. You allowed them at some point.
        4. You can disable or block all or some.

        Answer:

        B. These are push notifications, not pop-ups, because they are coming up on the desktop, not in a browser. You can definitely do something about them. In order for them to show, you would have had to innocently agree to them at some point. And yes, you can disable or block all or some of them. You may want some notifications and not others. In Windows 10, open Settings ➢ System ➢ Notifications & actions to manage which notifications you see. In Windows 11, go to Settings ➢ System ➢ Notifications. Choosing which ones can also be done through your browser and how depends on the browser being used. In Chrome, look for Settings ➢ Security and Privacy ➢ Site Settings ➢ Notifications, and there you'll find the settings. In Edge, go to Settings ➢ Cookies and site permissions ➢ Notifications. Each browser (Safari, Firefox, Opera, and so on) has its own path to the settings, and they may change over time, but all will allow you to choose which notifications to see and which to block.
102.    You're attempting to update an Android phone but receive an error message that the update failed. Which of the following could be the problem? (Choose two.)

        1. The device has insufficient storage space.
        2. There is a good Wi-Fi connection.
        3. There is insufficient battery power.
        4. The device is plugged into its charger.

        Answer:

        A, C. An Android device won't perform an OS update under the following conditions: if the Wi-Fi connection is not strong enough, the battery power is too low, the storage space is too low, or the device is no longer supported. If there is insufficient storage, remove apps or data that are no longer needed to make room for the update. Ensure that there is a good Wi-Fi connection. If the battery power is insufficient, plug the device in until it is fully charged.
103.    You're considering installing a desktop alert system for your business, which has both in-house and remote workers. Which of the following are true regarding desktop alerts? (Choose two.)

        1. Desktop alerts are limited to desktops.
        2. Desktop alerts provide an excellent emergency communication system such as weather alerts.
        3. Desktop alerts are text only, not graphics.
        4. Desktop alert software can be made interactive and can become a security threat.

        Answer:

        B, D. It's possible that you've already signed up for desktop alerts. If you receive weather warnings on your computer or phone, or school closings, power outages, or other notifications, these are desktop alerts. Desktop alerts can be displayed on wall-mounted displays, desktops, mobile devices, and phones, and they are an excellent way to provide mass notifications to affected people. They can include text and graphics, and they can be made full screen and interactive so that the receiver can respond. But like many other useful features in computer systems, they can be abused by those with malicious intent. For example, an interactive button on a desktop alert could be used to deploy malware when the user clicks it. There are many third-party vendors for desktop alert systems.
104.    A friend asks you what jailbreaking a device is and if they should do it. Which of the following is not true about jailbreaking?

        1. Jailbreaking is like cracking software or gaining root access to a phone, which makes your device more vulnerable to attack.
        2. Jailbreaking might be illegal depending on where you are in the world.
        3. Jailbreaking is a safe way to get more out of your device.
        4. Jailbreaking gives the user full access to the device, and on an iPhone, it allows the user to download apps not approved by Apple.

        Answer:

        C. Jailbreaking does let you do more with your device, but it isn't necessarily safe or legal. Jailbreaking is most commonly done with Apple devices because they are more locked down (closed-source) than Android (open source). Jailbreaking an iPhone, for instance, allows the user to install apps that are not approved by Apple. When you open the device up for yourself by cracking software or gaining root access, it also opens your device up more for cybercriminals to perpetrate an attack on it. Jailbreaking also voids the warranty on your device. The device may become unstable, and with the warranty voided, you are not likely to receive support in fixing problems. Jailbreaking may even be illegal depending on where you are in the world.
105.    A user is attempting to install new features for an app from the developer's website instead of from the Google Play app store, where they originally downloaded the app. The update with the new features fails to install. Why? (Choose two.)

        1. The signatures don't match.
        2. The update is an APK format.
        3. Only Google can write apps for Android devices.
        4. The website is likely spoofed.

        Answer:

        A, D. Apps from the Google Play app store are required to be signed by the developer, and any updates won't be installed unless the signatures for the update and the original software match. This is a security feature for Android devices. If the signatures don't match, an error message like “Signatures do not match previously installed version” will appear. If you've downloaded the update from somewhere other than the Google Play store and received this error, there is a good chance that the website is a spoof of the actual developer's site, and a criminal is trying to get you to install malware. Android package (APK) source is the format for Android apps on the Google Play store prior to August 2021. Updates for existing apps may still be in this format, but any newly developed apps after August 2021 on the Google Play store will be in an Android App Bundle (AAB) format.
106.    Recently you've noticed a suddenly high volume of traffic on the VLAN that is used by mobile devices at your business. You know that the number of mobile devices hasn't increased that much. What should you suspect?

        1. A mobile device is malfunctioning.
        2. One or more mobile devices is infected with malware.
        3. Devices are experiencing limited connectivity.
        4. Your monitoring software is infected.

        Answer:

        B. The most likely reason for a sudden, high increase in network traffic is that there is malware on the system and that malware is using your network to do something. Luckily the mobile devices are on a VLAN, so it isn't directly affecting your main network. You need to immediately identify the source of the network traffic and perform malware removal procedures. A mobile device malfunctioning is not likely to be the source of the problem. Limited connectivity would not present as an increase in network traffic, and it is unlikely that your monitoring software being infected is the problem. High network traffic is precisely the sort of incident that your monitoring software should be designed to detect.
107.    What is one of the best ways to prevent malware being spread by desktop alerts?

        1. Educate the end users.
        2. Block all desktop alerts.
        3. Always log in as an administrator.
        4. Update anti-malware once a month.

        Answer:

        A. Desktop alerts perform a valuable function, but they can be subject to misuse by cybercriminals. The best protection for this type of attack is user education. You would not want to block all desktop alerts because they serve a purpose, and you certainly don't want to log on as an administrator unless absolutely necessary to avoid an attacker gaining administrator access and to avoid accidentally doing something as an administrator that could damage a system, since administrators can do anything in a system. Anti-malware should be updated daily.
108.    You're attempting to boot a computer that worked fine yesterday, but today it says “OS not found.” What will you do first?

        1. Verify the boot options in BIOS/UEFI.
        2. Verify there are no media inserted into optical or USB drives.
        3. Restart the computer.
        4. Remove the USB drive.

        Answer:

        B. If a computer's boot order is set to boot only to a USB or optical drive, then leaving a nonbootable media in that drive will give the error that the OS is not found, when in fact it may be perfectly fine on the hard drive. Your first course of action is to verify that there are no media inserted into optical or USB drives. If you find it there, remove the nonbootable media and restart the computer. If it starts normally, the issue is resolved, but you shouldn't stop there. Enter the BIOS/UEFI and verify the boot options. For a secure environment you will want to disable booting to drives other than the intended boot drive, usually a hard drive. It's true that booting to alternate drives may be necessary when troubleshooting, but leaving that option always available opens the system up to potential attack.
109.    A user complains that their Windows 11 laptop seems to be unstable. They had installed some software and although they have removed it, the system is still behaving strangely. You have examined the system and determined that it is not infected with malware. What will you do next?

        1. Boot to installation media and reformat the hard drive, then reinstall the operating system.
        2. Hold the Shift key and restart the computer. The computer will restart in WinRE.
        3. Perform a system restore from the restore point created right before the software was installed.
        4. Delete the Registry and restart the computer.

        Answer:

        C. A seemingly unstable Windows installation may be repaired by using a system restore point from a time when the system was working well. If that doesn't resolve the issue, the next step would be to boot into WinRE ➢ Troubleshoot ➢ Reset this PC and choose to keep your personal files, performing an in-place update that will reinstall the Windows 11 operating system files. There is no need to reformat the drive and reinstall the OS or delete the Registry.
110.    You are donating some Windows computers and old mobile devices to charity. What should you do before you give them away?

        1. Replace the storage media with new media and destroy the old storage media.
        2. Delete all your personal/company files.
        3. Perform an in-place update.
        4. Perform a Factory Image Restore.

        Answer:

        D. Whenever a device will leave your possession, whether it is being donated or recycled, you need to ensure that all data is removed from the device. The simplest way to do this is by restoring the device to its factory settings, if a restore image is available. In many Windows devices this is done through WinRE ➢ Troubleshoot ➢ Factory Image Restore. The process for a factory image restore on phones and mobile devices will be different depending on the device.
111.    Your company uses an Active Directory domain to control resources on your network. They also use a PC image to prepare computers for first use within your organization. One of your computer users complains that they can't print, and a few other activities are working strangely. You have determined that there is no malware on the system. What will you do to restore this computer to working order?

        1. Back up the user files and reinstall the operating system.
        2. Reinstall the company's PC image.
        3. Boot into WinRE and reset the PC, keeping the user files.
        4. Boot into WinRE and perform a Factory Image Restore.

        Answer:

        B. If the computer is behaving strangely, the simplest fix is to reinstall the company's PC image. This will delete any files that exist on the computer and install any software and settings that are necessary for the company. The user can then log into the domain. There is no need to back up their files because on the domain their files will be saved in a home directory on a server. Booting into WinRE to reset or perform a factory restore is not the best way to resolve the problem.
112.    When booting a Windows workstation, a user receives an error message about a missing DLL file. However, Windows still loads. Which utility should you use to attempt to fix the error?

        1. SFC
        2. Recovery Console
        3. `regedit`
        4. `services.msc`

        Answer:

        A. System File Checker (SFC) is a great tool to use to fix a corrupted DLL file. Numerous dynamic link library (DLL) files are required to boot, but usually the lack of or corruption of one of them produces a noncritical error. Enter an elevated command prompt and run the command **`sfc /scannow`** to find and repair problems with system files.
113.    You are training a class on the installation and repair of Windows 10 and 11. What is the purpose of the Windows PE? (Choose two.)

        1. Runs as an operating system on thin clients
        2. Collects information during a Windows installation
        3. Launches the WinRE for troubleshooting
        4. Repairs system files if any become corrupted

        Answer:

        B, C. The Windows Preinstallation Environment (PE) is a minimal operating system, designed to prepare a computer for installation or to boot into for launching troubleshooting tools such as the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). It is not intended to be an operating system on a computer but rather a stepping-stone to get an OS installed or repaired.
114.    A Windows user has noticed that some of their files are missing or renamed. They want to know who has successfully logged into their PC recently. What Event Viewer log file will you look at?

        1. Security
        2. System
        3. Software
        4. Authentication

        Answer:

        A. The Windows Event Viewer utility provides information about what's been going on with the whole system to help you troubleshoot problems. Event Viewer shows warnings, error messages, and records of things that have happened successfully. It's found in all current versions of Windows. The three most commonly referenced logs are Security (which includes information about logins), System, and Application. The Security log can be used to audit successful and failed access attempts. The system log contains information about system events such as drivers started and programs running in the background. Software and Authentication are not logs in Event Viewer.
115.    Your Windows workstation is having problems at startup. Too many applications are loading, and it is slowing the system down considerably. Which tool should you use to disable programs from loading automatically at startup?

        1. Registry Editor
        2. System Configuration
        3. System Information
        4. Task Manager

        Answer:

        D. If too many applications starting up when Windows loads is causing problems such as a very slow boot and the system running slowly, use the Startup tab in Task Manager to disable them. The Registry Editor is intended for making changes to the Registry directly and is only used when absolutely necessary, as many of the same changes can be done using Control Panel or Settings apps. System configuration can be used in troubleshooting by choosing a Diagnostic or Selective startup, and System Information provides a wealth of information about the hardware and software in your system.
