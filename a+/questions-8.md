# Questions

1.  You have a client who needs to plug three workstations and displays into a wall outlet that has only two plugs. They're looking for the least expensive solution available. What should you recommend they purchase?

    1. UPS
    2. Voltage conserver
    3. Surge protector
    4. Power strip

    Answer:

    D. Power strips come in all shapes and sizes and are convenient for plugging multiple devices into one wall outlet. Most of them even have an on/off switch so that you can turn all the devices on or off at the same time. Don't make the mistake of thinking that power strips will protect equipment from electrical surges, though. If there is a strong power surge through one of these inexpensive devices, the strip and everything plugged into it can be damaged.
2.  Which of the following is a way to provide proof that a computer user agrees to the acceptable use policy (AUP) and any changes to it every time they log into a computer connected to your network?

    1. Incident report
    2. Splash screen notice
    3. The act of logging in
    4. Signature on an AUP

    Answer:

    B. A splash screen appears on a computer before a user logs in. It can contain information related to the acceptable use policy (AUP) or regulatory information that the user must agree and adhere to. This information is accepted by clicking a button indicating agreement to it before they can log in. The act of logging in alone does not prove acceptance of the conditions unless there is a statement telling the user that they must either accept the conditions or not continue. An incident report is filed when someone identifies a breach of company policies. A signature on an AUP should always be obtained as a part of onboarding, but it won't include any changes to the policy.
3.  You are upgrading a video card in a desktop computer. You are following appropriate safety procedures. When you open the case, what is the most common danger that you should watch out for?

    1. Electrical shock
    2. Sharp edges
    3. Burns
    4. Flying debris

    Answer:

    B. One component that people frequently overlook is the case itself. Cases are generally made of metal, and some computer cases have sharp edges inside, so be careful when handling them. You can, for example, cut yourself by jamming your fingers between the case and the frame when you try to force the case back on. Motherboards and expansion cards have sharp solder projections on the bottom that can cut as can a moving fan (which would only be on if troubleshooting a power issue). Less often injuries can occur from the power supply and processor. The power supply could provide a shock because it contains capacitors that hold a charge for a time after the power is turned off. You could be burned by a processor if removing it before it has had adequate time to cool off. Flying debris inside the case is very unlikely.
4.  A user needs to send a file to a coworker. The user has no working USB ports, disk drives, or network shares. The file is too large for email. What third-party software feature is the user requiring?

    1. USB share
    2. Encryption
    3. File share
    4. VPN

    Answer:

    C. If the user has third-party software offering file sharing capability—for example, Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, or Google Chrome—then the file could be transferred to others via the file sharing software. Using encryption and establishing a VPN are not necessary. There is no need for USB sharing without a USB port.
5.  You open a desktop computer case and discover some dust, particularly around the fans. What should you use to clean the fans out?

    1. Denatured isopropyl alcohol
    2. Demineralized water
    3. Computer vacuum
    4. Compressed air

    Answer:

    D. One way to keep dust and debris out of your computer is to use an enclosure, which is basically an extra case. But if dust and debris do get inside your case, the best way to remove it is to use compressed air instead of vacuuming. Compressed air can be more easily directed and doesn't tend to produce ESD damage as a vacuum could. Simply blow the dust from inside the computer by using a stream of compressed air. However, make sure to do this outside so that you don't blow dust all over your work area or yourself, and place a pen or pencil in the fan so it won't spin while you're dusting it off. Denatured isopropyl alcohol is used to clean contacts because it dries quickly, and demineralized water would not be used inside the case, except perhaps in a liquid cooling system.
6.  What feature of third-party software would allow a technician to demonstrate to a user how to use an application on the local desktop?

    1. File sharing
    2. SSH
    3. Browsing
    4. Screen-sharing

    Answer:

    D. Third-party software that includes a screen-sharing feature would allow the technician to demonstrate a task using the user's own local desktop. File-sharing software facilitates the sharing of files, SSH (Secure Shell) is an encryption protocol and set of utilities for managing systems remotely, and browsing is not a type of screen-sharing.
7.  Which of the following is both a protocol and a suite of utilities that allow network administrators to remotely access and manage systems while maintaining the confidentiality of authentication credentials and data?

    1. RDP
    2. SSH
    3. HTTPS
    4. SFTP

    Answer:

    B. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), and File Transfer Protocol Secure (SFTP) provide confidentiality of network traffic, but SSH provides that and a suite of utilities that is commonly used by network administrators to remotely control and manage networks.
8.  You are installing a new piece of software on your computer, and you do not agree with terms in the end-user license agreement (EULA). Which of the following statements is true?

    1. You can skip the EULA and continue the installation.
    2. You will not be able to install the software unless you agree to the terms in the EULA.
    3. You can click that you agree with the EULA and then provide notes to the parts you disagree with and will not be bound to those terms.
    4. You can install the software but will be provided with limited functionality.

    Answer:

    B. An end-user license agreement (EULA) is a contract between you and the entity providing the software. When you buy an application, you aren't actually buying the application. Instead, you're buying the right to use the application in a limited way as prescribed by the licensing agreement that comes with it. Don't like the terms? Too bad. No negotiation is allowed. If you don't accept the EULA, your only recourse is to return the software for a refund.
9.  Your company has a policy prohibiting illegal content on work computers. You have seized a workstation from an employee after finding illegal content. How do you ensure that the illegal material is managed in the correct way and that it is delivered to the proper authorities?

    1. Use documentation.
    2. Follow the chain of custody policy.
    3. Drive the computer to the proper law enforcement agency.
    4. Remove the hard drive and preserve it in a locked safe.

    Answer:

    B. After the device or data has been preserved, someone needs to keep track of it before it's handed over to the proper authorities. The specific next step depends on your documented chain of custody policy. Depending on the situation, materials may be held in a safe, locked location at the office, or they may need to be turned over to local authorities. Have a documented procedure in place to follow, given a situation. Always document the findings, who has custody of the illegal materials, and if/when the custody is transferred to someone else.
10. You just got off a repair job at a customer's site, and it was difficult. To make matters worse, the customer was argumentative and difficult to work with. Which of the following should you not do?

    1. Document the situation in your work log.
    2. Try to put the experience out of your mind and focus on your next call.
    3. Call your manager and explain the situation.
    4. Post the experience on social media.

    Answer:

    D. One of the golden rules of customer service is, don't vent about customers on social media. You never know who will read it, and regardless, it's unprofessional to air dirty laundry. Depending on the situation, it may be advisable to discuss it with your manager or simply document it and move on with your day.
11. You are fixing a broken printer on the second floor of your office building. When you get the printer running again, you notice that it's printing off employee paychecks. What should you do?

    1. Take pictures of the paychecks and post them on social media.
    2. Look to see how much everyone gets paid compared to what you get paid.
    3. Ignore the information and focus on making sure the printer is fixed.
    4. Text your friends and tell them that you make more than they do.

    Answer:

    C. IT professionals often deal with confidential, private, or restricted information. Other users trust that IT professionals will treat the sensitive material as such and not spread information. Ignore the paychecks and focus on doing the job professionally.
12. When you are working at a client's site, which of the following is the most appropriate behavior you should exhibit?

    1. Taking personal calls
    2. Taking notes and asking questions
    3. Visiting social media sites
    4. Talking to coworkers

    Answer:

    B. Avoid distraction and/or interruptions when talking with customers. You need to make them feel that their problem is important and that it has your full attention. Distractions can include personal calls, texting, social media, talking to coworkers, and other personal interruptions. Taking notes and asking appropriate questions is part of good customer service.
13. You are in the field replacing a defective PCIe network card in a desktop computer. You realize that you forgot your ESD strap. The computer needs to be fixed quickly. What is the best way to put yourself at the same electrical potential so that you won't damage the equipment with ESD?

    1. Touch the ground before working on the PC.
    2. Touch the plastic front of the case while working on the PC.
    3. Stay in contact with the computer's desk while working on the PC.
    4. Stay in contact with the metal part of the case while working on the PC.

    Answer:

    D. Putting yourself at the same electrical potential is not as effective as using proper anti-ESD gear, but it makes up for that with its simplicity. Make sure the computer is turned off and unplugged. Then touch an exposed (but not hot or sharp!) metal part of the case. That will drain electrical charge from you. Better yet is if you can maintain constant contact with that metal part. That should keep you at the same electrical potential as the case.
14. What Microsoft protocol allows you to connect your local system to a different Microsoft client, complete with a graphical user interface?

    1. RDP
    2. SSH
    3. SFTP
    4. VPN

    Answer:

    A. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) lets you establish a connection to a remote client, showing the remote system's desktop. Secure Shell (SSH) lets administrators securely manage networks remotely, File Transfer Protocol Secure (SFTP) is for moving large files securely, and a virtual private network (VPN) uses encryption to create a private connection across a public network.
15. When working with a customer, which of the following demonstrates proper communication technique and professionalism?

    1. Staring at religious artifacts hanging on the wall
    2. Imitating the client's accent when speaking to them
    3. Using the client's professional title when speaking to them
    4. Laughing at the client's choice of clothing

    Answer:

    C. It is important for an IT technician to be culturally sensitive. Some people may have a language barrier that makes it difficult to explain their problem. (Think about how little computer language you learned in your high school language courses!) Others may have different habits or practices in their workplace. Be respectful of their world. In some cases, using the appropriate professional titles is a sign of respect and not using them is an insult.
16. You are practicing appropriate safety procedures as you fix computers. Which of the following are times you should wear an ESD strap? (Choose two.)

    1. Working inside a desktop case
    2. Working inside a power supply
    3. Working inside a laser printer
    4. Working inside a laptop case

    Answer:

    A, D. To use the ESD strap, you attach one end to an earth ground (or more typically, the computer case) and wrap the other end around your wrist. This strap grounds your body and keeps it at a zero charge. Never wear an ESD strap if you're working inside a laser printer or inside a power supply. If you wear one while working on the inside of these components, you increase the chance of getting a lethal shock.
17. While cleaning out an old filing cabinet, you discover a box filled with discarded batteries. What is the proper way to dispose of them?

    1. Burn them.
    2. Throw them in the trash.
    3. Crush them.
    4. Recycle them.

    Answer:

    D. When batteries are thrown away and deposited into landfills, the heavy metals inside them will find their way into the ground. From there, they can pollute water sources and eventually find their way into the supply of drinking water. The best way to dispose of old batteries is to recycle them.
18. Your company has a policy prohibiting illegal content on work computers. A user reports that another user has illegal content, and you are the first responder at the scene. What is the first step you should take as the first responder?

    1. Follow the chain of custody.
    2. Preserve the data or device.
    3. Identify the illegal content that violates policy.
    4. Ask the user to delete the material.

    Answer:

    C. If you have your policy in place, then your incident response plan should be relatively scripted. Your first priority as the first responder is to identify the improper activity or content. Then you should always get someone else to verify the material or action so that it doesn't turn into a situation of your word against someone else's. Immediately report the situation through proper channels.
19. When communicating with customers, which of the following should you do?

    1. Use jargon and acronyms to provide your abilities.
    2. Interrupt and ask questions often to clarify.
    3. Use appropriate professional titles.
    4. Assume you know what the customer wants, even if it's not what they said.

    Answer:

    C. When dealing with a customer, always display professionalism. That means avoiding slang, jargon, and acronyms; not interrupting; and clarifying what the customer wants.
20. You are transporting several sticks of RAM and a few video cards from one of your offices to another. Which safety device should you use to help avoid electrically damaging the components?

    1. Antistatic bags
    2. ESD strap
    3. ESD mat
    4. Rubber gloves

    Answer:

    A. Static-shielding bags are important to have at your disposal when servicing electronic components because they protect the sensitive electronic devices from stray static charges. This is in contrast to the familiar pink antistatic bags, which only prohibit static buildup found in other plastic bags but do not shield from ESD. By design, the static charges collect on the outside of these silver or pink bags rather than on the electronic components. Unlike antistatic mats, antistatic bags do not “drain” the charges away, and they should never be used in place of an antistatic mat. Components should never be placed on an antistatic bag. While mats are designed to be stationary on a bench, bags are built for portability.
21. Your company has a policy prohibiting illegal content on work computers. You have identified illegal content on a user's computer, you have reported the incident through proper channels, and the workstation has been removed from the user's desk. What is the right next step in the incident response process?

    1. Document the situation.
    2. Notify the proper authorities.
    3. Follow the chain of custody.
    4. Delete the illegal material.

    Answer:

    A. After the device or data has been properly secured and preserved, document everything that could be relevant to the situation. Many companies have standard documentation that is used in incident response to be sure that the responder captures important information and does not forget to ask critical questions or look for vital clues.
22. You are working on-site and trying to fix a client's workstation. Their computer has a defective video card, and it will take about three days to get a new one in. Which of the following is the best course of action for you to take?

    1. Tell them it will take three days for the video card to arrive, and you will return then to replace it.
    2. Tell them that the video card is defective, not fixable, and it will take a week for the new one to arrive. Then when you replace it in three days, you will have overdelivered versus exceeded their expectations.
    3. Tell them it will take three days for the new video card to arrive. Offer to supply a loaner computer that they can use in the meantime.
    4. Tell the customer that the computer is not working, and you'll be back to fix it whenever you can fit it into your schedule.

    Answer:

    C. Set and meet—or exceed—expectations and be sure to communicate timelines and status with the customer. Customers want to know what's going on. In addition, offering different repair or replacement options will usually make the customer feel better because you are giving them an option in choosing a solution.
23. You are troubleshooting a difficult problem that you have never seen before. Even after an hour, you're still not sure what is causing the problem. The customer asks what's wrong. What should you tell them?

    1. You have no idea, and it's a hard one. This is going to take a while.
    2. You're not sure yet, but you're confident that you'll get it figured out soon.
    3. It's bad. It's really bad. You're not sure if you will ever get it fixed.
    4. Not even your escalation line could figure it out, so you're about ready to just give up.

    Answer:

    B. When dealing with customers, it's important to maintain a positive attitude and project confidence. Remember that if they have called you, they're already having a bad day, and they are counting on you to resolve the problem.
24. You are advising a startup that handles payment transactions to employ additional security controls on credit card information. What type of compliance affects how these security controls are implemented?

    1. PII
    2. PCI DSS
    3. VPN
    4. SSH

    Answer:

    B. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to any organization that handles credit card data or processes or stores payment transactions from bank cards. PII is personally identifiable information, VPN stands for virtual private network, and Secure Shell (SSH) is an encryption protocol.
25. You are working on an LCD that has a flickering display. Which component inside the display poses the biggest risk for delivering an electrical shock?

    1. Backlight
    2. Capacitors
    3. Inverter
    4. Screen

    Answer:

    C. LCDs do not use capacitors. Instead, they require an inverter, which changes direct current to alternating current and provides the high-voltage, high-frequency energy needed to power the backlight. The inverter is a small circuit board installed behind the LCD panel. Inverters store energy even when their power source is cut off, so they have the potential to discharge that energy if you mess with them. The screen itself does not have an electrical charge.
26. Your office uses five HP LaserJet printers. An administrator has placed used toner cartridges in boxes and stacked them in the storage room. Which of the following statements is true regarding toner cartridge disposal?

    1. Toner is not harmful, but because they contain plastic, they should be recycled.
    2. Toner is not harmful and the cartridges are made of biodegradable plastic, so they can be thrown away.
    3. Toner will make a mess if it gets out of the cartridge, so to avoid making a mess, cartridges should be burned.
    4. Toner is a carcinogen, so cartridges should be taken to an authorized recycling center.

    Answer:

    D. The toner itself is a carcinogen, and the cartridges can contain heavy metals that are bad for the environment. PC recycling centers will take old toner cartridges and properly dispose of them. Most toner cartridge manufacturers will also take them back for recycling.
27. A desktop computer you are working on has a failed power supply. Another technician suggests that it could just be a failed capacitor inside the power supply and you could fix it. What should you do?

    1. Open the power supply, and test the capacitors with a multimeter.
    2. Do not open the power supply; dispose of it properly.
    3. Open the power supply and test the capacitors with a voltmeter.
    4. Open the power supply and test the capacitors with an electrical probe.

    Answer:

    B. Although it is possible to open a power supply to work on it, doing so is not recommended. Power supplies contain several capacitors that can hold lethal charges long after they have been unplugged! It is extremely dangerous to open the case of a power supply. Besides, power supplies are relatively inexpensive. It would probably cost less to replace one than to try to fix it, and this approach would be much safer. Only open a power supply if you have been specifically trained how to safely repair them.
28. You are having a conversation with your manager about corporate security best practices. They ask what the company should do if users are found to have adult content or content that advocates hate crimes on their workstations. How should you answer?

    1. Users should be allowed to keep it if it is for personal use only.
    2. The company should implement a policy that forbids such material and specifies consequences for violating the policy.
    3. The company should not condone adult or hate crime–related content but can't legally prevent users from having it.
    4. The company should ignore the content that users have on their workstations.

    Answer:

    B. Creating a policy is the most important part of dealing with prohibited content or actions. Without a policy in place that specifically defines what is and what isn't allowed and what actions will be taken when a violation of the policy occurs, you don't really have a leg to stand on when a situation happens. What is in the policy depends on the company for which you work. A good policy will also contain the action steps to be taken if prohibited content or activity is spotted. Those actions may involve disciplinary action, termination of employment, or contacting of law enforcement.
29. You are training a new group of technicians on power issues. One asks if an under-voltage event or complete power failure can affect the company's computer systems. What should you say? (Choose two.)

    1. A complete power failure can damage electrical components.
    2. An under-voltage event will not be detected by computer equipment because there is not complete power loss, so equipment won't be damaged.
    3. Both complete power failures and under-voltage events can damage electrical components.
    4. An under-voltage event might cause a monitor to flicker, but it won't damage electrical components.

    Answer:

    A, C. Both power failures and under-voltage events can damage computers and other electronic devices. Under-voltage events can sometimes go unnoticed, or your display may flicker and lights dim.
30. When dealing with a customer, which of the following demonstrates the communication technique for using proper language?

    1. Use computer jargon.
    2. Use acronyms.
    3. Use slang terms.
    4. Use basic terms.

    Answer:

    D. When talking with customers it's important to remember that they don't have the training that you do, so they won't understand all the terminology that technicians use. Describe the situation in terms that the user will understand, but don't be condescending. Never use jargon, acronyms, or slang terms, even if they are commonly used with your peers. It takes practice to put complex concepts in simple terms, but your customers will appreciate it. More tech-savvy customers will usually let you know that they understand and you can use more advanced terms with them as needed.
31. You have downloaded open source software onto your personal laptop. Which of the following statements are true regarding open source licenses? (Choose two.)

    1. You can modify the application in any way you like.
    2. You do not need to pay for the application.
    3. You can make changes only to the applications that are approved by the originator.
    4. You pay a fee for every user of the application.

    Answer:

    A, B. Open source software is free, not only is the application free, but the source code (code used by programmers) is also shared to encourage others to contribute to the future development and improvement of the application. Open source software can't be sold, although it can be bundled with commercial products that are sold. Contrast open source with commercial licenses, where you pay per user and can't modify the program except as allowed by the developer.
32. You want to install an electrical device that lets you plug in multiple devices at the same time. It should have a fuse in it so that if there is a power surge (over-voltage event), the fuse will be blown and the electronics plugged into it won't be damaged. It does not need a battery backup. What type of device do you need?

    1. UPS
    2. Power strip
    3. Battery backup
    4. Surge suppressor

    Answer:

    D. Devices that attempt to keep power surges at bay are called surge suppressors. They often look like a power strip, so it's easy to mistake one for the other, but suppressors are more expensive. They have a fuse inside them that is designed to blow if it receives too much current and not to transfer the current to the devices plugged into it. Surge protectors may also have receptacles for RJ-45 (Ethernet), coaxial, and USB or other connectors.
33. When dealing with a customer and demonstrating proper communication techniques, what is meant by actively listening? (Choose two.)

    1. Taking notes and making eye contact
    2. Repeating back to the customer what you believe they just said, starting with something like, “If I understand you correctly…”
    3. Walking to the computer with the problem and starting to open it while listening
    4. Answering texts while listening

    Answer:

    A, B. Active listening means paying attention to your customers (eye contact is good) and taking notes. Allow them to complete their statements and avoid interrupting them. Don't do something else like texting or walking away while they are talking to you. People like to know that they are being heard and understood, and as simple an act as it is, this can make all the difference in making them feel at ease with your work.
34. You are troubleshooting a desktop computer that is prone to shorting out and rebooting. When you open the case, there is a layer of grime on all the internal components. When you remove the expansion cards and memory, what should you use to clean the metal contacts on the cards?

    1. Demineralized water
    2. Mild soap and water
    3. Denatured isopropyl alcohol
    4. Compressed air

    Answer:

    C. Compressed air won't likely blow the grime away. Electronic connectors of computer equipment should never touch water. Instead, use a lint-free swab moistened in distilled, denatured isopropyl alcohol (also known as electronics or contact cleaner and found in electronics stores) to clean contacts. You may have heard people say to use an eraser, but that could remove some of the soft gold from the contacts and damage the component, so don't use an eraser.
35. You are installing a server for a small company. They want to be sure that the server can be shut down properly in the event of a power failure, so they don't lose data. Which device should you recommend they plug the server into?

    1. Battery backup
    2. Voltage regulator
    3. Surge suppressor
    4. Power strip

    Answer:

    A. The best device for power protection is called an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), also known as a battery backup. These devices can be as small as a brick or as large as an entire server rack. Inside the UPS is one or more batteries and fuses. Much like a surge suppressor, a UPS is designed to protect everything that's plugged into it from power surges. They are also designed to protect against under-voltage events and even complete power failures. Energy is stored in the batteries, and if the power fails, the batteries can power the computer for a period of time so that the administrator can then safely power it down. Voltage regulators are an electronic component found on some circuit boards.
36. You need to upgrade the RAM in a desktop computer. Which of the following should you do before beginning the procedure?

    1. Leave the computer running.
    2. Put the desktop into hibernate mode.
    3. Turn the PC off and unplug the power cord.
    4. Put the desktop into standby mode.

    Answer:

    C. Whenever working inside the case, always off turn the power and unplug the unit from the power source. The only exception to this rule is when troubleshooting a power issue and you need to leave the computer on to figure out the problem.
37. You are moving computer equipment from an old office to a new office. Which of the following are good personal safety measures to follow to avoid injuries? (Choose two.)

    1. Bend at the knees and lift with your legs.
    2. Bend at the waist and lift straight up.
    3. For heavy items, get a partner to help you lift and/or use a cart to move the item.
    4. When lifting, lift objects as high as possible to avoid running into things.

    Answer:

    A, C. The muscles in the lower back aren't nearly as strong as those in the legs or other parts of the body. Whenever lifting, you want to reduce the strain on those lower-back muscles as much as possible. To do that, bend at the knees and lift with your legs. Also observe weight limitations and partner-lift if needed. Better yet, partner-lift and use a cart to move items. Also, keep objects close to your body and at waist level to minimize stress on your body.
38. You have opened a desktop computer case and will be upgrading the memory. To help prevent ESD, you put an ESD strap on your wrist. Where should you connect the other end?

    1. The RAM
    2. The motherboard
    3. The metal case
    4. The plastic table

    Answer:

    C. To use the ESD (electrostatic discharge) strap, you attach one end to an earth ground (typically, the computer case) and wrap the other end around your wrist. Some ESD mats have a connector for the ESD strap. This strap grounds your body and keeps it at a zero charge, which helps prevent you from accidentally damaging components with a jolt of static electricity.
39. You are purchasing new spreadsheet software for your company. Your manager has instructed you to ensure that you purchase enough licenses for everyone in the office to use the product. What type of license will you likely purchase, designed for large groups of users? (Choose two.)

    1. Corporate
    2. Single user
    3. Concurrent
    4. Shareware

    Answer:

    A, C. Shareware generally does not require licensing, and payment may be handled via the honor system. But shareware is generally not a good choice for a corporate environment where you depend on the software. Some shareware will also specify that it is only free if used for personal use, but in a corporate environment, a fee must be paid. A single-user license is good for only one user. You could buy a lot of single-user licenses, but that is generally more expensive than buying a concurrent or corporate license. Corporate and concurrent licenses are designed for large groups of users.
40. You have several old computers that you want to dispose of. What should you do with them?

    1. Throw them in the trash.
    2. Remove the hard drives to avoid having someone steal confidential data and then throw them in the trash.
    3. Donate or dispose of them in compliance with government regulations.
    4. Put them at the curb for someone to take for free.

    Answer:

    C. If you can't find a way to reuse the equipment, be sure to dispose of it in compliance with government regulations. Most computers contain small amounts of hazardous substances, so they should be recycled by professionals who know how to deal with those dangers. Many municipalities, states, and countries have regulations in place specifying appropriate measures to enforce their proper disposal. Search the Internet for certified recycling programs near you.
41. You fixed a customer's laptop about three days ago. Which of the following demonstrates proper communication techniques and professionalism?

    1. Call the customer to see whether they are satisfied with the repair.
    2. Post “Another satisfied customer!” on your social media sites with a picture of their office building.
    3. Provide an accurate bill for services provided.
    4. Call the customer and ask if they have additional work you can do.

    Answer:

    A. You should always set expectations with the customer and then meet or exceed them. After resolving a customer's issue, follow up with them to ensure that they are satisfied with the services you provided. The follow-up shows professionalism and may earn you future business.
42. You are troubleshooting problems in a client's office, and the client starts arguing with you as to what the problem is. What should you do?

    1. Avoid arguing and becoming defensive.
    2. Argue back to prove that you are correct.
    3. Tell the client that they are making you uncomfortable and leave immediately.
    4. Tell the client that if they know so much, they can fix it themselves. Then leave.

    Answer:

    A. In difficult situations, it can be challenging to keep a level head. It's important to do so and avoid arguing and becoming defensive. Remember that if a client had to call you, they're likely already having a bad day and may be frustrated. Sometimes they will take their frustration out on you. Keep a level head and work to resolve the problem.
43. Your company has a policy prohibiting illegal content on work computers. You have identified illegal content on a company-owned workstation. What is your next step?

    1. Get someone else to verify.
    2. Report through proper channels.
    3. Ask the user to delete the material.
    4. Preserve the data or device.

    Answer:

    A. If you have your policy in place, then your incident response plan should be relatively scripted. Your first priority as the first responder is to identify the improper activity or content. Then you should always get someone else to verify the material or action so that it doesn't turn into a situation of your word against someone else's, then immediately report the situation through proper channels.
44. You are going to be upgrading the RAM on several desktop computers. Which of the following environmental conditions increases the risk of ESD damaging computer components?

    1. High temperature
    2. Low temperature
    3. High humidity
    4. Low humidity

    Answer:

    D. When humidity gets to be very low, around 20 percent or lower, the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD) increases. Remember that computer components can be damaged with very little voltage, even less than the shock you feel when you touch a metal doorknob after walking across a carpet. Always use ESD protection to prevent damage to components.
45. Your company has a policy prohibiting illegal content on work computers. You have found illegal content on a user's workstation. What is the proper way to preserve the data or device?

    1. Ask the user to not delete the data from the device.
    2. Take a picture of the illegal content and email it to your manager.
    3. Take a picture of the illegal content and email it to yourself.
    4. Remove the data or device from the possession of the offending user and preserve it in a safe location.

    Answer:

    D. If you have your policy in place, then your incident response plan should be relatively scripted. After identifying illegal content, you need to preserve that content. The method of preserving the data depends on exactly what format that data is in. For example, if the data is held in RAM, you can't turn the computer off. If it is files on the hard drive, you could turn the PC off and remove the hard drive. In any case, the data or device should immediately be removed from the possession of the offending party and preserved. This will ensure that the data doesn't mysteriously disappear before the proper parties are notified.
46. Your company maintains a database of customers' names, vehicle license plate numbers, and driver's license numbers. What type of policy should your company have regarding this information?

    1. This information can't be used in any damaging way; therefore, no special policy is needed.
    2. This information is related to motor vehicle operation, and no special policy is needed.
    3. This information is public information, and no special policy is needed.
    4. This is PII and personal government-issued information and should be kept confidential and secure.

    Answer:

    D. Personally identifiable information (PII) is anything that can be used to identify an individual person on its own or in context with other information. This includes someone's full name, address, other contact information; the names of family members; and other details that people would consider private. PII should always be kept confidential and secure. Government-issued information are data such as Social Security numbers, license numbers, passport data, and other government identifications. Be sure that this information is properly secured and can be accessed only by authorized personnel. There are rules and regulations for how this data can be stored, accessed, and used. This is known as regulated data.
47. You are looking for a new software application for your company's financial data users, but you have a limited budget. Which of the following types of software licensing would you expect to not have to pay for? (Choose two.)

    1. Corporate
    2. Open source
    3. Single user
    4. Freeware

    Answer:

    B, D. Freeware is an easy choice, because it's free. Open source software is often also free, and you can modify the code free of charge as well (if you have the skills to do so). Some shareware is free, but it depends on the program. Single-user and corporate licenses generally cost money. The downside of freeware or open source software is that there might not be sufficient support for it if you run into any difficulties.
48. You are setting up a repair shop for PCs. To reduce the risk of damaging computer components with static electricity, which of the following devices should you use? (Choose two.)

    1. Magnetic screwdrivers
    2. ESD mats
    3. ESD straps
    4. A dehumidifier

    Answer:

    B, C. It is possible to damage a device by simply laying it on a benchtop. For this reason, you should have an ESD (electrostatic discharge) mat in addition to an ESD strap. This mat drains excess charge away from any item coming into contact with it. ESD mats are also sold as mouse/keyboard pads to prevent ESD charges from interfering with the operation of the computer. Many ESD wrist straps can be connected to the mat, thus causing the technician and any equipment in contact with the mat to be at the same electrical potential and eliminating ESD. Magnetic screwdrivers are not a good idea because they could damage a computer chip if they inadvertently come into contact with it. A dehumidifier removes excess moisture from the air. The correct air moisture content for working on computer equipment is about 50 percent. In cold climates, you're more likely to need a humidifier, to add moisture to air because too little moisture creates more static electricity. Too much moisture can cause components to corrode.
49. You have chosen to use compressed air to clean away dirt and debris from the inside of a desktop computer case. What is the recommended safety gear you should wear?

    1. Safety goggles and an air filtration mask
    2. Safety goggles and a respirator
    3. Safety goggles, a respirator, and a hair net
    4. A biohazard suit

    Answer:

    A. When compressed air is used, particles of dirt and debris can become airborne, and they can be inhaled or get into your eyes. Always wear proper safety gear, such as safety goggles and an air filtration mask.
50. What type of information likely needs access safeguards per regulatory requirements as it relates to an individual's medical records?

    1. Personally identifiable information
    2. Protected healthcare data
    3. Driver's license number
    4. Place of employment

    Answer:

    B. A person's medical records and health information is classified as protected health information (PHI) (listed as Healthcare data on the CompTIA A+ objectives) and must be protected according to regulatory requirements such as HIPAA. A driver's license number and place of employment may be considered personally identifiable information (PII).
51. You need to dispose of a chemical solvent but are unsure how to properly do so. Where will you find information on this as well as the potential dangers the solvent possesses?

    1. MSDS/SDS
    2. OSHA
    3. Warning label
    4. Bottom of the container

    Answer:

    A. A safety data sheet (SDS) is required for any chemicals that are sold and include information such as the physical product data (boiling point, melting point, flash point, and so forth), potential health risks, storage and disposal recommendations, and spill/leak procedures. With this information, technicians and emergency personnel know how to handle the product as well as respond in the event of an emergency. The term material safety data sheet (MSDS) was replaced with the term safety data sheet in 2015, but you may still see it on the CompTIA A+ exam as MSDS.
52. You are discussing the placement of several new computers with one of your coworkers. Which of the following are the best places to put them? (Choose two.)

    1. In the corner of a room that is typically about 15 degrees warmer than room temperature
    2. In an open area at room temperature
    3. In the corner of a room that is typically about 15 degrees colder than room temperature
    4. In an enclosed kiosk so that no users can damage the system

    Answer:

    B, C. Computers generally tolerate temperature and humidity levels about the same as humans do, except electronic devices do like it a bit colder. The general rule of thumb is room temperature or cooler, average humidity, and good ventilation.
53. A user's work area is littered with debris and crumbs, and they report that keys on their keyboard stick or sometimes make a crunching sound. What should be the first option for cleaning this keyboard?

    1. Denatured isopropyl alcohol
    2. Demineralized water
    3. Computer vacuum
    4. Compressed air

    Answer:

    D. The first option should be a few, quick blasts of compressed air, to immediately blow out the crumbs and debris. If that first option does not work, then the demineralized water should clean anything spilled on a keyboard. Bear in mind that when you use demineralized water, it will then take a few days to dry out the keyboard, and it shouldn't be used until it's dry.
54. You are performing a safety audit for your company and are examining the company's fire extinguishers. Which type of fire extinguisher is designed to put out electrical fires?

    1. A
    2. B
    3. C
    4. D

    Answer:

    C. Four major classes of fire extinguishers are available, one for each type of flammable substance: A for wood and paper fires, B for flammable liquids, C for electrical fires, and D (metal powder or NaCl \[salt]) for flammable metals such as phosphorus and sodium. The most popular type of fire extinguisher today is the multipurpose, or ABC-rated, extinguisher. It contains a dry chemical powder that smothers the fire and cools it at the same time. For electrical fires (which may be related to a shorted-out wire in a power supply), make sure the fire extinguisher will work for Class C fires.
55. You have a set meeting time with a client to upgrade their computer. Your prior service call runs long, and you will be late to the meeting. What should you do?

    1. Get to the meeting as soon as you are able.
    2. Take your time; you're already late and a few more minutes won't matter.
    3. Don't show up. Call the client later and tell them you were tied up.
    4. Call the client, apologize for being late, and explain that your last call went over. You will be there as soon as possible or can reschedule if they would prefer.

    Answer:

    D. Be on time, or five minutes early. If you're going to be late, be sure to contact your customer. Not doing so indicates that you think their problem isn't important.
56. You are asked to help a client who is unable to send or receive email. When you get to the client's desk, what should you do?

    1. Tell them that this problem is nothing and you have dealt with far worse issues today.
    2. Ask what they did to cause the problem.
    3. Tell them that you would rather be working on updating the server, but you suppose you'll deal with this problem first.
    4. Clarify the scope of the problem and verify that you understand exactly what isn't working correctly.

    Answer:

    D. Providing good customer service involves proper communication and professionalism. Dismissing customer problems is not good. Neither is asking accusatory questions. Clarify the scope of the problem and ask clarifying questions to ensure that you understand what isn't working properly.
57. Which of the following small devices should not be disposed of at a normal landfill but instead regarded as containing toxic chemicals? (Choose two.)

    1. Cell phone
    2. Phone packaging
    3. Light cardboard
    4. Tablet

    Answer:

    A, D. Both tablets and cell phones contain toxic chemicals such as beryllium, arsenic, and lead as well as rare-earth metals that could be recycled. None of what is inside most electronic devices belongs in a landfill. The other two options arguably belong elsewhere as well but are not considered toxic.
58. While changing a laser printer toner cartridge, a technician spilled toner on a desk. What should they use to clean the mess up?

    1. Compressed air
    2. Mild soap and water
    3. Toner vacuum
    4. Denatured isopropyl alcohol

    Answer:

    C. One unique challenge when cleaning printers is spilled toner. Getting it wet will make an inky mess. It sticks to everything and should not be blown into the air and inhaled; it's a carcinogen. Use an electronics vacuum that is designed specifically to pick up toner. A normal vacuum's filter isn't fine enough to catch all the particles, so the toner may be circulated into the air. Normal electronic vacuums may melt the toner instead of picking it up.
59. You are holding a laptop for someone who will be out of the country for a year or so. What is the best way to store their laptop battery to preserve its life?

    1. Store it in a cool, dry area.
    2. Store it in a closet.
    3. Store it at room temperature.
    4. Store it in a freezer.

    Answer:

    A. Extreme temperatures, either hot or cold, will negatively impact battery life. Batteries store best in cool (not frigid) temperatures. You may think that you should store it in a freezer, but that isn't good either because the freezer is likely a bit too cold, and they tend to have too much moisture. A closet is at room temperature, but someplace a few degrees cooler than room temperature and dry is the perfect storage area for a battery. You'll also want it to be about half charged when you store it, and bring it out periodically to charge and discharge, then store it again.
60. You are repairing a desktop PC and upgrading the memory. What is the most important reason that equipment grounding is an important safety procedure?

    1. To prevent an electrical shock to yourself
    2. To prevent an electrical shock from damaging components
    3. To prevent fire from starting inside the case
    4. To prevent the desktop PC from slipping off the workspace

    Answer:

    B. Enough electricity can hurt people, but tiny amounts can pose safety issues for computer components. One of the biggest concerns for components is electrostatic discharge (ESD). For the most part, ESD won't do serious damage to a person other than provide a little shock. But little amounts of ESD, smaller than you could see a spark or feel a zap, can cause serious damage to computer components, and that damage can manifest itself by causing computers or components to hang, reboot repeatedly, or fail completely.
61. What type of script has the filename extension `.ps1`?

    1. PowerShell
    2. Bash
    3. JavaScript
    4. Python

    Answer:

    A. PowerShell uses the `.ps1` filename extension. Linux-based Bash scripts use `.sh`, Python uses `.py`, and JavaScript uses `.js`.
62. What type of editor would you normally use to view a script with the filename extension `.vbs`?

    1. Vi
    2. Notepad
    3. Emacs
    4. CoffeeCup

    Answer:

    B. Visual Basic scripts, which have a .vbs extension, are run on Windows platforms, so Notepad would work to edit them, but the Linux/Unix editors emacs and vi would not be used to view a VB script. CoffeeCup is for editing HTML files.
63. What file extension is used with a plain-text script file that can be run or edited in a Windows command prompt?

    1. `.js`
    2. `.sh`
    3. `.py`
    4. `.bat`

    Answer:

    D. Batch scripting, which uses the filename extension `.bat`, is typically a series of command-line commands. Such a script file would run on the Windows systems' command line. The other filename extensions—`.js`, `.sh`, and `.py` —are JavaScript, shell, and Python, respectively. They each would require special additional software to be able to interpret the script.
64. What programming language uses files with the `.js` extension?

    1. JavaScript
    2. Java
    3. Juice
    4. Joomla

    Answer:

    A. JavaScript uses the `.js` filename extension. Java is a programming language. Juice is software to schedule downloading of podcasts, and Joomla is a web development platform. Of the four choices, only JavaScript is on the CompTIA A+ exam, so focus on that programming language's file extension.
65. What best practice assists the administrator to track the boundaries and perimeters of data flow through the environment they are responsible for?

    1. Asset tagging
    2. Change management
    3. Password policy
    4. Network topology diagrams

    Answer:

    D. Network topology diagrams will illustrate how the network connects and routes in and around the environment. Diagraming the network's hardware and paths show a topology of perimeters and boundaries.
66. What best practice helps the administrator keep track of the hardware found throughout the workplace?

    1. Knowledge base articles
    2. Asset tagging
    3. Password policy
    4. Network topology diagrams

    Answer:

    B. Asset tagging hardware such as desktops and laptops can help an administrator quickly know the details of a particular asset. Inventory management is more easily accomplished with asset tagging.
67. What describes the best practice of documenting learned experience and helpful content to be shared with others?

    1. Brown bagging
    2. Knowledge base article writing
    3. Change board documentation
    4. Change management policy

    Answer:

    B. Writing knowledge base articles to share with others, namely for those with similar tasks or duties in your environment, can be very helpful. Compared to the time and money spent on repeated discovery for a solution, writing knowledge base articles is a small investment. A change board is usually a group that approves of proposed changes as a part of project management. Change management policy describes the procedures to be followed if a major system change is needed. Brown bagging means bringing lunch from home.
68. The operations manager wants to employ asset management but does not wish to spend funds on equipping all hardware with RFID tags. What is an appropriate but less expensive option?

    1. Sharpie
    2. Color coding
    3. Association to user by name and role
    4. Barcodes/QR codes

    Answer:

    D. Barcodes or quick response (QR) codes printed on physical tags that are then affixed to hardware to be managed are an inexpensive option to RFID asset tags.
69. What change management detail is not necessary to document?

    1. Purpose of the change
    2. Scope of the change
    3. Unaffected applications
    4. Approval

    Answer:

    C. Every documented change should include the reason or purpose of the change. The reason can explain the justification to those unfamiliar with the situation before the change. The scope of the change documents what is affected by the change. The approval, arguably the most important part, documents the management's support of the change. Documenting what applications are not affected by the change is an unnecessary step.
70. In considering an anticipated change, what highlights how the change will be received by a sample of the employees?

    1. Rollback plan
    2. Plan for change
    3. Risk analysis
    4. End-user acceptance

    Answer:

    D. End-user acceptance isn't necessarily documented, but it means that the change is welcomed, agreed upon, and supported by end users. End-user acceptance is important to the success of any major change that affects how the end users do their job, and there are actions that can be taken to help ensure end-user acceptance such as including end users in the planning process and explaining in detail why a change that affects them needs to be made. The rollback plan documents the actions to take in the event the change must be stopped for some reason once the process has started. The plan for change documents detailed actions to take to implement the change as well as the purpose of the change, date and time of the change, the scope of the change, impact on the affected systems, and request forms and approvals. A risk analysis is performed to assess, and likely accept, any additional exposure caused by the change.
71. A network administrator wrote and documented business continuation procedures, including backup schedules. Finally, critical data was backed up as required. What should be done next before the implementation can be considered reliable?

    1. Backup testing
    2. Documenting a checklist
    3. End-user acceptance
    4. Approval of the policy

    Answer:

    A. The greatest backup procedures in the world will not help if your backups are not reliable. Backups need to be tested on a regular basis to ensure that they can be restored if the need ever arises.
72. In a geographical area prone to tornados, what option for storing backups seems most sensible?

    1. Tape backups in the basement
    2. Tapes distributed among offices
    3. Cloud storage off-site
    4. Storage on a server against an inside wall.

    Answer:

    C. Depending on the disaster, the question of cloud storage versus local storage backups can significantly affect the success of recovery. For example, for a server hardware failure or a recent malware incident, local storage provides adequate security of backups. However, catastrophic collapse of the building would mean local storage is not accessible.
73. Your company uses a ticketing system to keep track of repair calls. Which of the following might not be included in the information gathered for the ticketing system when the client/customer calls?

    1. User information
    2. Device information
    3. Description of the problem
    4. Inventory lists

    Answer:

    D. Inventory lists are a feature of asset management, not ticketing systems. On the initial call, a user would typically gather information about the user, such as their name and contact information, the device that has a problem, and a description of the problem.
74. What change-management document describes the procedures that will occur if you reach a critical go/no-go point in a project that makes a change to your network and decide that it's a no-go?

    1. Sandbox testing
    2. Rollback plan
    3. Request forms
    4. Risk analysis

    Answer:

    B. Whenever you're planning a change to a business system, you need to have a plan in place to return to the old system if the planned change doesn't work out as thought. The plan to revert to the old system is known as a rollback plan. Sandbox testing is done before implementing changes to ensure that the changes will work. Request forms happen at the beginning of change management, and risk analysis examines whether to proceed with the change.
75. What type of backup is done that will include all files, whether or not the archive bit is set?

    1. Complete backup
    2. Incremental backup
    3. Full backup
    4. Differential backup

    Answer:

    C. A full backup creates a copy of all files whether or not their archive bit is set. An incremental backup will back up files that have changed since the last backup was made. Incremental backups and full backups reset the archive bit. Differential backups will back up all changes since the last full or incremental backup was performed. Differential backups do not reset the archive bit.
76. On Sunday, your system will automatically create a full backup of your data. At the end of each weekday, Monday through Friday, a differential backup is created. It is now Thursday morning, and you discover that your system crashed during the night. You need to restore your data. Which backups will you need to restore to get all of your data back?

    1. Only Wednesday's backup
    2. Sunday and Wednesday backups
    3. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday backups
    4. Sunday and Thursday backups

    Answer:

    B. When using full backups and differential backups to restore a system, you'll need the last one of each to recover all the data. Each differential backup is larger than the one before, because it includes the cumulative backup of all the changes that have happened since the last full backup. The backups are slower than incremental backups to create, but restoring them is easier because there are fewer datasets to restore.
77. Which of the following statements comparing differential and incremental backups are true? (Choose two.)

    1. Incremental backups are created faster than differential.
    2. Differential backups are created faster than incremental.
    3. Incremental backups are more fault tolerant than differential backups.
    4. Differential backups are simpler to restore than incremental.

    Answer:

    A, D. Incremental backups are created faster over time than differential backups. If each weekday the same number of files were changed, an incremental backup on Wednesday would only take one-third as long as a differential backup, because the differential backup would have Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday's changes. The Wednesday incremental backup would only have Wednesday's changes. Differential backups are easier to restore because you would only restore the last full backup and the most recent differential backup. Incremental backups are less fault tolerant than differential because there are more possible points of failure in the form of a greater number of backups that would need to be restored to achieve the same result as a differential backup. If your procedure is to perform a full backup each Sunday, and daily backups each night, and you discover on Thursday morning that your system crashed, then if you needed to restore from incremental backups you would have four backups to restore (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), whereas using differential backups would only require restoring two (Sunday and Wednesday).
78. Which of the following is true about how computer components such as expansion cards and processors should be stored?

    1. In antistatic bags, with protective packing material
    2. In zippered plastic bags, stacked on plastic shelves
    3. In antistatic bags, neatly stacked up on a grounded shelf
    4. On top of antistatic bags, on a shelf in a closet

    Answer:

    A. Static sensitive components should be stored in (not on) antistatic bags. If possible, use the protective packaging that came with them. They should not be stored in plastic bags or on plastic shelves because most plastics gather static. The exception would be shelves that are specifically made to be static free. Expansion cards should never be stacked on top of each other because doing so could damage or dislodge chips on the card. If you must store several of them, put each in its own box or a divided box made for that purpose. Antistatic bags are made to keep the static on the outside of the bag, like a mini Faraday cage, so placing sensitive components on an antistatic bag is like asking for trouble.
79. What should always be done before moving a laser printer?

    1. Remove the printhead.
    2. Remove stapler assembly.
    3. Remove the toner cartridge(s).
    4. Remove the paper.

    Answer:

    C. If you were moving a laser printer more than from one room to another, you would certainly want to check the manufacturer's recommendations for moving the equipment, but whenever you are moving a laser printer, it's important to remove the toner cartridges first. The cartridge may get jostled during the move and toner spilled inside the machine. That would create a hazardous situation for both you and the machine. Laser printers don't have printheads. The stapler assembly should be fine but again, check the manufacturer's documentation. Removing the paper is likely not necessary.
80. A manufacturing facility asked to have a computer installed on the floor for workers to access so they can check production information. About a week later, they have called you down because the computer isn't working. When you arrive, you find that someone has wrapped the computer in plastic to protect it from the dust, and it's about a hundred degrees Fahrenheit on the plant floor. Why did the computer quit working? (Choose two.)

    1. Too much dust on the plant floor.
    2. Lack of ventilation/airflow.
    3. Overheating.
    4. It is unplugged.

    Answer:

    B, C. Computers will shut down when the CPU has exceeded an acceptable heat level. Components may start acting strangely as well if they are too warm. Not only is the ambient temperature too warm, but by wrapping it in plastic the computer can't get the necessary airflow to keep the components from overheating. They may need to move this computer to a cooled, protective enclosure.
81. You are about to retire a computer because it's being replaced with a faster one that the new updated software needs. Which of the following needs to be done with this computer before it is recycled or donated? (Choose two.)

    1. Ensure that all data is removed/destroyed.
    2. Take it to the sandbox testing area.
    3. Remove it from the asset management inventory list.
    4. Install the new software update.

    Answer:

    A, C. When retiring equipment, there should be a checklist of things to do. First and foremost, ensure that there is no confidential data on the equipment, then remove it from the asset management inventory list. You could then donate or recycle it. A sandbox is a testing area that is set up like your systems but separate from them and used when testing a new configuration, software, or process. You would not install the new software update on this machine. If anything, this machine would be restored to the factory default.
82. You work as the lead IT network engineer at an IT services company that designs and installs networks for your Fortune 500 clients. Today you're meeting with the CIO of a large accounting firm. Which of the following are likely to be appropriate attire for your position and interaction with clients? (Choose two.)

    1. Matching suit coat and pants/skirt, tie if appropriate
    2. Khaki pants and polo shirt
    3. Business casual attire
    4. Business formal attire

    Answer:

    A, D. If you're in a lead role where you meet with clients in larger businesses, you will likely want to dress in business formal attire, which would include matching suit coat and pants or skirt and a tie if appropriate. Business casual attire for many techs is the familiar khaki pants and polo shirt, but it's not what you would wear to impress a potential new client.
83. You've just finished repairing a customer's printing problem and shown them how to avoid the problem in the future. What steps do you still need to take before the job is considered complete? (Choose two.)

    1. Provide documentation on the services provided.
    2. Tell them if they call you directly, they can get the same service for less money in the future.
    3. Follow up with the customer a few days later to ensure that they are satisfied.
    4. Leave without saying anything.

    Answer:

    A, C. You need to provide the customer with the proper documentation according to your company, but usually this will include a description of the problem when and how long you were there and a “big picture” description of what was done. You also need to call them a few days later to ensure that they are still happy with the service they received. You would not tell them to call you directly and you'll charge less, or you probably wouldn't have a job for long. You also would not leave without talking to the customer. Ideally, have them test the changes that you made to ensure things are working well for them.
84. A coworker has called the help desk because they have a problem with their PC. When you start to sit down at their desk, you see a job application there. What do you do?

    1. Ask them politely if they would mind moving their paperwork while you are working there; explain that you don't want to see anything that might be confidential.
    2. Go to their boss and tell them that the person is looking for another job.
    3. Snap a picture of the job application to post on social media.
    4. Ask them about the job they are applying for.

    Answer:

    A. As a technician you'll probably come into contact with all sorts of confidential or privileged information, whether it is the business files on someone's computer or their personal photographs and documents. You do your best to mind your own business, but sometimes you're going to see things. Unless it's illegal or you're bound by company policy to report it, ignore it. Forget that you saw it and don't talk to anyone about it. You're there to do a job. That's all.
85. Your company needs an occasional full backup, but your data is so large that the time it takes is considerable. Rather than do a full backup daily, you have elected to use software that combines incremental backups and a prior full backup to create a new full backup. What type of backup is this?

    1. Incremental
    2. Differential
    3. Synthetic
    4. Grandfather

    Answer:

    C. A full backup that is created from a prior full backup and one or more incremental backups is known as a synthetic backup. The advantages are that it takes much less time to create a backup because you only need to perform incremental backups, and if you must restore from a backup, it takes less time because you can always have a full backup. Incremental only backs up what has changed since the last incremental or full backup, and differential backs up whatever has changed since the last full backup. Differential backups don't reset the archive bit, but full backups and incremental backups do.
86. You know that a backup is only good if you can restore from it, so the backups need to be tested periodically to ensure that data can, in fact, be restored from them. Which of the following is not true regarding testing data backups?

    1. Test whenever there have been big system changes like new software, major updates, or major data changes.
    2. Test after every single backup.
    3. Test whenever there are going to be big system changes like merging databases, or installing or updating software.
    4. Test once a month.

    Answer:

    B. In an ideal world, it would be great to test the backup for integrity after every backup, but that would be prohibitive in terms of the time it would take. They should be tested often, at least once a month but more often if you are able, and certainly after something significant has changed in a system. You would also want to ensure that you have a good backup before you make those big changes.
87. You work for an IT services company and today you're acting as the lead network installer. In this job you'll be running wires through ceilings and walls, and possibly interacting with your customer. What would be the appropriate attire to wear?

    1. Casual, graphic T-shirt and jeans
    2. Sneakers
    3. Business formal
    4. Company logo polo shirt and casual pants

    Answer:

    D. You would not want to wear business formal, which is a suit and dress shoes, if you're running wires. You also don't want to be so casual that you look unprofessional. Here business casual is more appropriate and exactly what that means will depend on the policies of your company. For many technicians it's nice jeans or casual pants and a button-up shirt or a sweater, not a dress shirt, but also not a t-shirt or hoodie. Many companies will have attire with their logo that they prefer you wear. Sometimes IT techs get dirty.
88. In the United States there is a government entity that oversees safety in the workplace and has the authority to shut down businesses that don't comply with these safety standards. Who is that entity?

    1. OSHA
    2. The NEC
    3. FEMA
    4. IRS

    Answer:

    A. In the United States, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) oversees workplace safety and makes rules that companies must abide by, including training workers on working safely. If the company fails to make changes after an OSHA inspection, OSHA has the option to close them down. The NEC (National Electrical Code) is a document that was developed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) for wiring and building buildings that are safe. Their rules have been adopted by all 50 states of the United States as a part of their building code. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps in the event of natural disasters, and the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) is responsible for collecting income taxes.
89. Which information technology rule states that you need three copies of data, on two different media, and one copy off-site?

    1. Grandfather-father-son (GFS)
    2. On-site/off-site backup rule
    3. The rule of 78
    4. The 3-2-1 backup rule

    Answer:

    D. The 3-2-1 backup rule states that you need three copies of data, on two different media and one of them is off-site. Grandfather-father-son is a rotation scheme for backup media. The rule of 78 is an accounting rule used to calculate interest payments, and there is no common rule called the on-site/off-site backup rule.
90. You forgot a file that you need for a presentation today. It's on your Windows Pro computer at home. Which of the following could you use to retrieve it?

    1. RMM
    2. VPN
    3. VNC
    4. MRSA

    Answer:

    C. A virtual network computer (VNC) allows a user to manipulate a computer remotely. Some VNC systems allow a smartphone to control a computer remotely, some allow for file transfer, but not all. Windows Remote Desktop, which uses the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), is a type of VNC that is part of the Windows operating system. Remote monitoring and management (RMM) is a category of software used by managed service providers to remotely manage, configure, and control the resources of many different networks. A virtual private network (VPN) allows a user to be away from their office, such as a remote worker or traveling salesperson, and connect to the company server or other resources with their laptop or other mobile computer as if they were in the company offices. Microsoft Remote Assistance (MRSA) could not be used as it would require someone at the home computer to send the invitation.
91. You're having a first meeting with a potential customer at a company that you have been told wears jeans and t-shirts to work, even the CEO. What would be the appropriate attire for this meeting?

    1. Jeans and a t-shirt with their company logo
    2. Casual attire
    3. Business casual
    4. Business formal

    Answer:

    D. Until or unless they invite you to wear casual attire, you should dress in business formal attire. Even though they are a casual company, you still need to project a professional image, especially for a first meeting.
92. What is the term that means a company follows state, local, federal and even international government rules and regulations that relate to their work?

    1. Disobedience
    2. Regulatory compliance
    3. Information Technology Governance
    4. Information security

    Answer:

    B. Regulatory compliance means that you're following all the laws that pertain to your company and its locations. These can be local, state or provincial, federal, or even international laws. Failure to be in compliance with government regulations can result in fines, company closure, or even jail time. Disobedience would be the opposite of compliance. Information technology governance means that the structures, processes, and actions of a company's IT department are in line with the overall goals and objectives of the company. Information security is ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of an organization's information.
93. Which backup scheme ensures that there are short-term, medium-term, and long-term backups that a business could restore from, and in theory they would never lose more than a day's worth of data and would always have a year's worth of backups?

    1. Grandfather-father-son (GFS)
    2. On-site/off-site backup rule
    3. Moore's law
    4. The 3-2-1 backup rule

    Answer:

    A. Grandfather-father-son is a rotation scheme for backup media. For a typical small business, the “son” backups would be labeled Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Seven days later they are overwritten. Each Friday a “father” backup is made, so there would always be four or five father backups, which would be overwritten a month later. The grandfather backups are made only once a month, so they won't be overwritten for a year. The 3-2-1 backup rule states that you need three copies of data, on two different media and one of them off-site. Moore's law says that technology doubles every two years, and there is no common rule called the on-site/off-site backup rule.
94. Part of the HIPAA regulations state that if a document is created it must be maintained for a minimum period of six years from when it was created or last in effect. What is this an example of?

    1. IT governance
    2. Data retention requirements
    3. GFS
    4. License agreement

    Answer:

    B. This is a data retention requirement, and only one of many that may affect an IT department and the data that they are responsible for. Data retention requirements are a part of regulated data. IT governance has to do with keeping the objectives of the IT department in alignment with the goals and objectives of the organization as a whole. GFS (grandfather-father-son) is a popular backup media rotation scheme, and a license agreement is a contract between you and the software company that is granting you a license to use their software.
95. You and your best friend intend to start a managed services provider (MSP) company, providing technical computer support to business clients. What software will you need to invest in that will enable you to manage those clients and fix many software-related issues without leaving your office?

    1. RMM
    2. VPN
    3. VNC
    4. RDP

    Answer:

    A. Remote monitoring and management (RMM) is a category of software used by managed service providers to remotely manage, configure, and control the resources of many different IT networks. A virtual private network (VPN) allows a user to be away from their office, such as a remote worker or traveling salesperson, and connect to the company server or other resources with their laptop or other mobile computer as if they were in the company offices. A virtual network computer (VNC) allows a user to manipulate a computer remotely. Some VNC systems allow a smartphone to control a computer remotely, and Remote Desktop, which uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), is a type of VNC that is part of the Windows operating system.
96. An employee has a personal-use license for some free diagramming software that they feel would be beneficial for your company. You have evaluated the software and determined that the software company also has corporate licenses for more than one user, for an annual licensing fee. Which of the following is most likely what the employee is allowed to do under the terms of their personal use license?

    1. Make as many copies as they want.
    2. Bring it into work for everyone to use.
    3. Sell the software for download online.
    4. It depends on the exact terms of the software license, but most likely, use the software on their personal computer(s) at home only.

    Answer:

    D. Personal-use software is sometimes distributed free to individuals in the hope that they will like it so much they will be willing to pay for premium features or purchase corporate licenses for their place of business. Some of these licenses allow users to make and distribute free copies of the software to their friends so that they can try it too. Most will not allow them to bring it into their company without paying for it, nor are they allowed to sell it. Exactly what you can do with a software that is licensed to you as an individual is covered in the end-user license agreement (EULA) that you agreed to when installing or downloading the software.
97. What technology lets authors, musicians, artists, and other creators of copyrighted material control access to their content so that it is not stolen or illegally shared?

    1. Personal licenses
    2. Digital rights management
    3. Corporate licenses
    4. Nonexpired licenses

    Answer:

    B. Digital rights management (DRM) means using technology to protect the copyrighted material created by artists and others from being stolen. Musicians, programmers, movie makers, authors, and so on put sometimes immeasurable hours and great expense into creating their work. To keep others from stealing it, they can use technology to control the number of people who can access content, or sharing, printing, saving, and so on. Some DRM software can limit access to information based on IP address, or even cause watermarks to appear when someone tries to print a document or image that they don't have the right to print.
98. Which of the following may be undesirable results of using scripts? (Choose two.)

    1. Unintentionally introducing malware
    2. Installing applications
    3. Inadvertently changing system settings
    4. Initiating updates

    Answer:

    A, C. Occasionally scripts have unintended results when they are run. They can include, but are not limited to, unintentionally introducing malware, inadvertently changing system settings, or causing browser or system crashes because they are using too many resources. These occasional mistakes are far outweighed by their uses, such as remotely installing applications, installing updates, automating backups, and restarting machines, just to name a few.
99. What remote access technology allows the users to co-control a desktop instead of the remote user taking over?

    1. MSRA
    2. RDP
    3. SSH
    4. RMM

    Answer:

    A. Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA) allows a user to invite someone to help them or lets them offer to help someone else. Both users can see and control the screen. This is a great way to show someone how to perform a task and have them try it while you are watching. Remote Desktop, which uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), is used to control a remote computer as if you were sitting at it. Secure Shell (SSH) is both a protocol and suite of tools for an administrator for secure, remote management of networked resources. Remote monitoring and management (RMM) is a category of software used by managed service providers to remotely manage, configure, and control the resources of many different networks.
100.    One of your management employees works from home most days, but they need to have access to the server as if they were sitting there in the office, and the connection must be secure. What technology will you employ to do this?

        1. RMM
        2. VPN
        3. RDP
        4. VNC

        Answer:

        B. A virtual private network (VPN) allows a user to be away from their office, such as a remote worker or traveling salesperson, and connect to the company server or other resources with their laptop or other mobile computer as if they were in the company offices. This is accomplished using tunneling protocols. It differs from a virtual network computer (VNC) in that the VNC allows a user to manipulate a computer remotely. Some VNC systems allow a smartphone to control a computer remotely. Remote monitoring and management (RMM) is a category of software used by managed service providers to remotely manage, configure, and control the resources of many different it networks, and Remote Desktop, which uses the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), is a type of VNC that is part of the Windows operating system.
101.    Which of the following would not be a possible consequence of failure to maintain compliance with government regulations?

        1. Fines and fees
        2. Business shutdown
        3. Extra paid holidays
        4. Lives lost

        Answer:

        C. If you fail to comply with government regulations, there are usually severe consequences. Not only fines and fees, business shutdown, or possible jail time, but for example, if a failure to comply with rules meant that someone's health data was hacked, the cost could be measured in lives lost.
102.    Which of the following is not an example of regulated data?

        1. Credit card transactions
        2. Software licensing data for software that you use
        3. Healthcare data
        4. Personally Identifiable Information

        Answer:

        B. While it is important to maintain records of your software licenses, the way that data set is stored, moved, and used is not regulated. Credit card transactions, healthcare data, and personally identifiable information (PII) all have industry and/or governmental rules about what happens to that data. Data is worth far more than the hardware that it resides on, so ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility (CIA) of that information is a primary concern of any IT department.
103.    Which of these third-party tools allows multiple users in diverse locations to see one another, possibly share a screen, and discuss information with one another as if they were in the same room?

        1. Screen-sharing software
        2. File transfer software
        3. Desktop management software
        4. Videoconferencing software

        Answer:

        D. Videoconferencing software has been around for a long time. It enables people who might be on the other side of the world to take part in the same meeting, seeing the other attendees and participating in discussions. Some types of videoconferencing software allow for screen sharing as well. Screen-sharing software enables you to show others a window or your entire desktop or a section of it (such as an application window). File transfer software enables secure and quick transfer of large files from one system to another, remote system. Desktop management software is any software that allows you to manage multiple desktops remotely, often on different platforms.
104.    Which of the following file extensions is used by a software in the Linux/Unix environment?

        1. `.sh`
        2. `.py`
        3. `.vbs`
        4. `.ps1`

        Answer:

        A. A filename with an `.sh` extension indicates that this is a script for Bash, which stands for Bourne-Again Shell. The other file extensions —`.py`, `.vbs`, and `.ps1`— are used in Python, Visual Basic, and PowerShell, respectively.
105.    Which of the following is not a type of information, recorded in a ticketing system, that needs to have very clear, concise, written communication?

        1. Problem descriptions
        2. Progress notes
        3. Valid licenses
        4. Problem resolution

        Answer:

        C. Tracking valid licenses is a part of asset management, not a ticketing system. It is very important that the problem description, progress notes, and resolution be written in clear, concise language so that anyone who reads them in the future will be able to understand what transpired.
106.    What is used to initiate the change management process?

        1. Affected systems/impact
        2. Request form
        3. Risk analysis
        4. Change board approval

        Answer:

        B. A request form is used to initiate the change management process. Risk analysis and a report of the affected systems and the impact on them is part of the document that is presented to the change board for their approval before the change is implemented.
107.    Which of the following would not be included in change management documentation?

        1. End-user acceptance
        2. Responsible staff member
        3. Affected systems and the impact on them
        4. Scope of the change

        Answer:

        A. End-user acceptance is a desirable result of meeting with and including end users in the decision-making process of change management. It is a desired result, not necessarily a part of the documentation. The responsible staff member needs to be listed in the documentation, and there will usually be a champion for the project, meaning someone in a position of power who supports the change who may or may not be listed as a responsible party. A careful analysis of the affected systems and the impact the change will have on them needs to be done and included. The change document needs to include the scope of the change, which is an explanation of what will and will not be changed and how far-reaching the project is.
108.    What type of software includes programs like batch files, Visual Basic, PowerShell, and so on, and is used for activities like basic automation, remapping network drives, automating backups, gathering information/data, and restarting machines based on triggers?

        1. Remote monitoring and management (RMM)
        2. Screen-sharing software
        3. Scripting programs
        4. Remote access technologies

        Answer:

        C. Batch files, Visual Basic, and PowerShell are all examples of scripting programs. They have many uses and are used daily by network administrators to facilitate management of their networks. Remote monitoring and management (RMM) is a type of remote access technology. Screen-sharing software lets the user show their screen to people who are working with them remotely.
109.    You are newly hired at the help desk of your company. Which one of the following are types of information that need not be included on each ticket in a ticketing system?

        1. Category of the problem
        2. Severity of the problem
        3. Escalation levels
        4. Procurement life cycle

        Answer:

        D. Every ticket in a help desk ticketing system should include the category of the problem, severity of the problem, and any escalation levels that were used. The procurement life cycle is a part of asset management.
110.    Which process is designed to enable changes that benefit an organization with as little disruption as possible to the IT services for an efficient function of that organization?

        1. Asset management
        2. Change management
        3. Ticketing systems
        4. Knowledge bases and articles

        Answer:

        B. The aim of change management is to control change in such a way that it continues to move the organization forward with as little disruption as possible to the employees and IT processes of the organization—to effect change without causing any adverse results or negative effects to the company's bottom line. Asset management is maintaining documentation on the IT assets of a company. Ticketing systems allow for tracking of support issues and results, and knowledge bases and articles provide a wealth of information for resolving IT problems that have been previously encountered.
111.    What part of asset management includes processes such as a request for information (RFI), a request for proposal (RFP), and identifying the business need?

        1. Database system
        2. Assigned users
        3. Procurement life cycle
        4. Warranty and licensing

        Answer:

        C. A database system, assigned users, and warranty and licensing, are all a part of asset management records. The procurement life cycle is also a part of asset management, and it starts with identifying a business need for what is being purchased. The exact steps may vary by company and be different for government entities, but they often include vendor analysis, request for information, and request for quote before a decision is made regarding what vendor to use and what specific products to purchase.
112.    What feature of change management examines all the possible positive and negative events that may impact a project, then identifies a response plan if the event occurs and assigns a score to the possible event?

        1. Scope of the change
        2. Change board approval
        3. Risk analysis/risk level
        4. Sandbox testing

        Answer:

        C. A part of every project should be the risk analysis with an identified risk level for each possible negative (or positive) event that may affect the project. The risk is assigned a score, the risk level, and response plans are identified so that in the event that the risk is realized, there is a clear plan of action to handle it. The scope of the change identifies what it will and will not affect. A change board approval is the last step before a kickoff meeting to initiate the change. Sandbox testing is setting up a system that mimics the production system in order to try the change in a safe environment before implementing it.
113.    What items can be used to facilitate onboarding (new hires) and offboarding (people leaving) of employees to ensure that new employees have everything they need to do their job and exiting employees aren't able to damage systems or take company information with them? (Choose two.)

        1. Incident report
        2. New-user setup checklist
        3. End-user termination checklist
        4. Splash screens

        Answer:

        B, C. It's easiest to onboard and offboard employees if you have a checklist to follow. The checklists can include items such as adding the employee to security groups based on their department or job title and ensuring that their user account is disabled when they leave. An incident report should be filed whenever an IT employee observes a breach of protocol regarding acceptable use or when someone is injured. Splash screens are a way to ensure nonrepudiation of agreement to company policies each time a user logs onto a company computer system.
114.    Your company has recently installed a server with HR information on it. The server, as with most systems, possesses input/output (I/O) ports and disk bays and is connected via network cable to the local client network. However, since the data center was full, the new server is temporarily placed in the printer room. What should be a primary concern of the responsible administrator?

        1. Security considerations of each access method
        2. I/O transfer bottleneck
        3. Ambient noise from server fans
        4. Scalability of the server while in the printer room

        Answer:

        A. The security considerations of each access method seem to be overlooked for this server. A server hosting confidential data, located in an open, shared environment, is not best practice.
115.    You want to ensure that employees aren't installing whatever software packages that they want to because of licensing concerns and possible impacts to your network. What document will you use to identify and explain what the procedures are for custom installation of software packages?

        1. End-user termination checklist
        2. New-user setup checklist
        3. Network topology diagram
        4. Standard operating procedures document

        Answer:

        D. Procedures for custom installation of software packages should be spelled out in a standard operating procedures document. This should also be a part of an acceptable use policy (AUP). The checklists for new employees and terminated employees will help to ensure that all necessary steps take place, and a network diagram identifies the boundaries and equipment used in a network.
116.    Which of the following is not important to keep track of as part of your inventory management system, and to ensure compliance with local, regional, national, or perhaps international regulations?

        1. Valid licenses in use by your company
        2. Nonexpired licenses in use by your company
        3. Technical jargon used by your company
        4. Open source licenses being used by your company

        Answer:

        C. Valid licenses are those that are not void for any reason, such as using a personal license for corporate use, having more users than are allowed by the license, or using a software with a license that has expired. Software licensing can be so complicated that there are companies who make their living ensuring that other companies are in compliance with licensing agreements. Even open source licenses that are used by a company should be documented, and a periodic accounting of all software on all computers should be made to ensure that the company is in compliance with licensing laws and agreements. Inventorying the software used by your company is just as important as keeping an inventory of the hardware.
117.    Which of the following would not constitute an invalid, and quite possibly illegal, use of software?

        1. Using a personal license in a corporate setting
        2. Having more users of the software than the license allows
        3. Using software whose license has expired
        4. Modifying open source software

        Answer:

        D. One of the great features of open source software is that you are allowed to modify the software code to meet your needs. The other three options for this question—using software licensed for personal use in a corporate setting, using more copies or having more users than the license allows, and using software whose license has expired—are all invalid uses of software and may subject you or your company to fines or even jail time. It's very important to keep an inventory of your software and valid, nonexpired licenses and where they are being used. You should do at least an annual accounting of all the software being used on all the computers in your organization.
