# Questions

1.  Which type of security device requires the user to insert some type of identification card to validate access?

    1. PIN code
    2. Badge reader
    3. Security token
    4. Biometrics

    Answer:

    B. A protected computer or area may have a badge reader into which you insert a smartcard. A smartcard is a type of badge or card that gives you access to resources, including buildings, parking lots, and computers. It contains information about your identity and access privileges. If using radio frequency identification (RFID), the reader is a wireless, no-contact technology and the user does not need to touch the card to the reader. A PIN (personal identification number) code is a number that would be entered to gain access to a system. A security token is something you have that is used to verify your identity; it can be a software or a hardware token. Biometrics are using part of your body as identification.
2.  Someone has configured an external server with an IP address that should belong to one of your sister company's servers. With this new computer, they are attempting to establish a connection to your internal network. What type of attack is this?

    1. Spoofing
    2. On-path attack
    3. Zombie/botnet
    4. Non-compliant system

    Answer:

    A. A spoofing attack is an attempt by someone or something to masquerade as someone else. This type of attack is usually considered an access attack. The most popular spoofing attacks today are IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, and DNS spoofing. This is an example of IP spoofing, where the goal is to make the data look as if it came from a trusted host when it didn't (thus spoofing the IP address of the sending host). On-path attacks occur when your data transmissions are intercepted by someone en route, then forwarded on to their destination, sometimes with changes, sometimes without. Zombie and botnet are attacks where the user of the computer doesn't know there is malware on their computer. Their computer is a zombie, and when many zombies are used to attack a system, it's known as a botnet attack. A noncompliant system is one that is not following best practices such as keeping the OS and anti-malware updated and the firewall enabled.
3.  What type of security device often incorporates RFID technology to grant personnel access to secure areas or resources?

    1. Smartcard
    2. Security token
    3. Access control vestibule
    4. Key fob

    Answer:

    A. A smartcard is a type of badge or card that gives the holder access to resources, including buildings, parking lots, and computers. It contains information about your identity and access privileges. Each area or computer has a card scanner or a reader in which you insert your card. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless, no-contact technology used with these cards and their accompanying reader. A security token is something you have that is used to verify your identity; it can be a software or a hardware token. An access control vestibule is an area between two doors, often with a security camera. The second door grants access to a secure area. A key fob is a small device used in two-factor identification. It can generate a number or have software on it that is read to gain access.
4.  You are configuring a wireless network for a small office. What should you enable for the best encryption possible for network transmissions?

    1. WPS
    2. WEP
    3. WPA
    4. WPA3

    Answer:

    D. There are generally four wireless encryption methods available. From least to most secure, they are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), and two newer versions of WPA called WPA2 and WPA3. WPA3 is the most secure and should be used unless strange circumstances prevent you from doing so, because WPA and WPA2 are no longer secure. WPS is an easy way to configure Wi-Fi for devices like printers, where a number would be generated on a printer, for example, and the number would need to be entered on the access point, or vice versa. WPS has security flaws and is not listed in the CompTIA A+ exam objectives.
5.  You work for a company that has employees fill out and manually sign personnel documents. Once the signed documents are scanned into a system, the paper copies are no longer needed. What should be done with the paper documents?

    1. Place them in the recycle bin.
    2. Shred them.
    3. Place them in the trash.
    4. Keep them in a locked cabinet.

    Answer:

    B. Companies normally generate a huge amount of paper, most of which eventually winds up in dumpsters or recycle bins. Dumpsters may contain information that is highly sensitive in nature, and attackers may seek it out by practicing dumpster diving. In high-security and government environments, if sensitive papers are no longer needed, they should be either shredded or burned.
6.  Which types of security threats involve the attacker attempting to directly contact a potential victim? (Choose two.)

    1. Spoofing
    2. Phishing
    3. Social engineering
    4. Brute-force attacking

    Answer:

    B, C. Social engineering is a process in which an attacker attempts to acquire information about your network and system by social means, such as talking to people in the organization, shoulder surfing, tailgating, or other methods. When this is done via email or instant messaging, it's called phishing. Spoofing involves pretending to be a trusted resource—for example, by using a trusted resource's IP address to gain access to something else. A brute-force attack usually involves software that keeps trying passwords or codes until it hits upon the right one to gain access.
7.  An employee uses their security badge to enter the building through a secured door. Another person tries to enter the building behind them before the door closes without swiping a badge. What type of behavior is the second person demonstrating?

    1. Shoulder surfing
    2. On-path attack
    3. Brute-force
    4. Tailgating

    Answer:

    D. Tailgating refers to being so close to someone when they enter a building that you can come in right behind them without needing to use a key, a card, or any other security device. Using an access control vestibule, which are devices such as small rooms that limit access to one or a few individuals, is a great way to stop tailgating. Revolving doors can also help prevent tailgating. Shoulder surfing is walking behind someone hoping to see passwords or other security information they may be entering. On-path attacks occur when your data transmissions are intercepted by someone enroute, then forwarded on to their destination, sometimes with changes, sometimes without. A brute-force attack usually involves software that keeps trying passwords or codes until it hits upon the right one to gain access.
8.  You have a Windows domain network and want to ensure that users are required to meet password complexity requirements. What is the best way to implement this on the network?

    1. Use a firewall.
    2. Use a VPN.
    3. Use Group Policy.
    4. Use DLP.

    Answer:

    C. In a Windows domain, password policies can be configured at the domain level using Group Policy Objects (GPOs). There are hundreds of variables that can be configured. Variables that can be configured relating to passwords include password complexity and length and the time between allowed changes to passwords, and a lockout policy for failed access attempts. A firewall can be configured to block certain types of traffic based on things like IP address, protocol, or MAC address. A VPN (virtual private network) is a secure path between a local and a remote device. Data loss prevention (DLP) is the process of monitoring and identifying sensitive data to make sure it is accessed only by authorized persons.
9.  You are planning security protocols for your company's new server room. What's the simplest way to help physically keep potential attackers away from your servers?

    1. Lock the door.
    2. Use cable locks.
    3. Install an access control vestibule.
    4. Implement biometrics.

    Answer:

    A. Sometimes the obvious solutions are the best ones! A key aspect of access control involves physical barriers. One of the easiest ways to prevent those intent on creating problems from physically entering your environment is to lock your doors and keep them out. Cable locks are used to secure mobile devices like laptops to a table or a fixed device so they can't be carried away. An access control vestibule is a small room between two doors, where the secure access area is beyond the second door, and biometrics are using a part of the body to identify a person.
10. A user on your network reported that their screen went blank and a message popped up. It's telling them that their files are no longer accessible, and if they want them back, they need to enter a credit card number and pay a $200 fee. Which type of malware has infected this system?

    1. Rootkit
    2. Ransomware
    3. Trojan
    4. Spyware

    Answer:

    B. With ransomware, software, often delivered through a Trojan, takes control of a system and demands that a third party be paid. The “control” can be accomplished by encrypting the hard drive, by changing user password information, or via any of several other creative ways. Users are usually assured that by paying the extortion amount (the ransom), they will be given the code needed to revert their systems to normal operations. Even among malware, ransomware is particularly nasty. A rootkit is software that gains access to a system as administrator, giving it full control over a system. Rootkits are adept at hiding their presence and are difficult to eradicate. A Trojan is named after the Trojan horse of mythology. Trojans are malicious software that hides in that fun game or screen saver that you just downloaded, and it installs when you install the innocent-looking files. Spyware is designed to watch what you do and where you go, hoping to gain information such as logins and passwords, and bank account numbers.
11. You are setting up a new wireless router for a home office. Which of the following should you change immediately when initially configuring the network? (Choose two.)

    1. The router's default administrator username and password
    2. The default SSID
    3. The radio power level
    4. The guest account password

    Answer:

    A, B. When configuring a new wireless router, always change the administrator's username and password first. This prevents would-be hackers from having easy access to the router. Then change the default SSID. These default values can easily be found online, and not changing them immediately makes your router vulnerable to attack. The radio power level might be changed later if you discover the signal is too weak or too strong. There is no guest account on a router.
12. You are configuring a router for a small office network. The network users should be able to access regular and secure websites and send and receive email. Those are the only connections allowed to the Internet. Which security feature should you configure to prevent additional traffic from coming through the router?

    1. MAC filtering
    2. Content filtering
    3. Port forwarding/mapping
    4. Port security/disabling unused ports

    Answer:

    D. Port security involves disabling all unneeded protocols/ports. In this case, ports 80 and 443 are needed for HTTP and HTTPS access, and ports 25, 110, 143, 465 or 587 may be needed for email. That's it. If you don't need them, remove the additional protocols, software, or services, or prevent them (disable them, or block them, as the setting is typically called on a router) from loading. Ports left open but not in use present an open door for an attacker to enter. MAC filtering is an option on most routers that will only allow devices with specific MAC addresses to access the router. Content filtering blocks undesirable traffic such as social media or hate sites on a corporate network. Port forwarding/mapping will send all traffic that comes in on a specified port number to a specific node on the network.
13. On a Windows 10 workstation, there are two NTFS volumes. The Managers group has Modify access to the `D:\mgmt` directory. You move the folder to the `D:\keyfiles` folder, to which the Managers group has Read access. What level of permissions will the Managers group have to the new `D:\keyfiles\mgmt` directory?

    1. Full Control
    2. Modify
    3. Read & Execute
    4. Read

    Answer:

    B. When you move a file or folder on the same NTFS volume, it will keep its original permissions. If you copy it or move it to a different volume, it will inherit permissions from its new parent directory.
14. For users to log on to your network from a remote location, they are required to supply a username and password as well as a code from an RSA token. What type of security is being used?

    1. Firewall
    2. Multifactor authentication
    3. Access control list
    4. Principle of least privilege

    Answer:

    B. When users log on to a computer or network, they are generally required to provide credentials such as a username or password. In multifactor authentication (MFA), the user is required to provide two or more items proving who they are. These items are generally from two of four categories: something they know (such as a password), something they have (such as a code from a security token), something they are (biometric screening), or somewhere they are (based on GPS location or Wi-Fi and cell tower triangulation). A firewall is a software or hardware device that will block traffic into or out of a network based on parameters that the administrator specifies. An access control list exists for each resource. It defines who has what level of access to that resource. The principle of least privilege states that you give a user only enough access to do what they need to do and nothing more.
15. You want to recycle some hard drives that your company no longer uses but want to ensure that other people will not be able to access the data. Which methods of removing the data are acceptable for your purposes? (Choose two.)

    1. Formatting the drive
    2. Using an overwrite utility
    3. Using a drive wipe utility
    4. Using electromagnetic fields

    Answer:

    B, C. The best methods are using either overwrite or drive wipe programs. Overwriting the drive entails copying over the data with new data. A common practice is to replace the data with 0s. Drive wipes do a similar thing. Formatting the drive does not guarantee that others can't read the data. Using electromagnetic fields (or degaussing) isn't reliable and can damage the hard drive, and it won't work at all on SSDs.
16. You have installed Windows 11 Pro on a workstation. For better security, which user account should you ensure is disabled?

    1. Administrator
    2. DefaultAccount
    3. Power User
    4. Guest

    Answer:

    D. When Windows is installed, one of the default accounts it creates is Guest, and this represents a weakness that can be exploited by an attacker. While the account cannot do much, it can provide initial access to a system, and the attacker can use that to find another account or acquire sensitive information about the system. To secure the system, disable all accounts that are not needed, especially the Guest account, which is disabled by default. The Administrator account should be renamed. If a hacker knows a valid username, then they are halfway into your system. The DefaultAccount is an account that is managed by the system and is disabled by default. Power User is not an account that is installed with Windows 11, but there is a Power Users group that is kept for backward compatibility.
17. Which type of network attack involves an intermediary hardware device intercepting data and altering it or transmitting it to an unauthorized user?

    1. On-path attack
    2. Non-compliant system
    3. Zombie/botnet
    4. Spoofing

    Answer:

    A. On-path attacks clandestinely place something (such as a piece of software or a rogue router) between a server and the user, and neither the server's administrator nor the user is aware of it. The on-path attack intercepts data, then sends the information to the server as if nothing is wrong. The on-path attack software may be recording information for someone to view later, altering it, or in some other way compromising the security of your system and session. A noncompliant system is one that is not in line with acceptable security policies and procedures. Zombie and botnet are attacks where the user of the computer doesn't know there is malware on their computer. Their computer is a zombie, and when many zombies are used to attack a system, it's known as a botnet attack. Spoofing occurs when another system pretends or appears to be a trusted system.
18. You are implementing new password policies for your network, and you want to follow guidelines for password best practices. Which of the following will best help improve the security of your network? (Choose two.)

    1. Require passwords to expire every 180 days.
    2. Require passwords to be a minimum of 8 characters.
    3. Require passwords to have a special character.
    4. Require passwords to be no more than 10 characters long.

    Answer:

    B, C. Setting strong passwords is critical to network security. They should be as long as possible. Eight or 10 characters is a good minimum. Users should also be required to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, a number, and a special character such as #, @, &, or others. Passwords should also expire, but 180 days is too long. Having a 45-day or 90-day requirement would be better.
19. What does NTFS use to track users and groups and their level of access to resources?

    1. ACLs
    2. Tokens
    3. Badges
    4. Control rosters

    Answer:

    A. With NTFS, each file, directory, and volume can have its own security. NTFS tracks security in access control lists (ACLs) for each resource. The ACL will contain the user or group name and the level of access they have been granted. The basic permissions to choose from are Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, Read, and Write. There are also special permissions and settings that can be applied. A token is software or hardware that is used in multifactor authentication and falls under the category of something that a user has. Badges may use RFID or other technology that is read to allow physical entry to a secure area. Control rosters are used in areas that have security guards and contain a list of people who are allowed to enter.
20. You have created a user account for a contract employee on a Windows 11 PC. The contractor will be with the company for one month. Which user group should this user's account be placed in?

    1. Power Users
    2. Administrators
    3. Standard Users
    4. Guest

    Answer:

    D. The Guest account is created by default (and should be disabled) and is a member of the Guests group. For the most part, members of Guests have the same rights as Users except they can't access log files. The best reason to make users members of the Guests group is to access the system only for a limited time. There is no group named Standard Users by default. There are groups created automatically called Users, Administrators, Power Users, Guests, and a few others. The Power Users group is kept for backward compatibility, but they are the same as someone in the Users group. Administrators have complete control over the systems that they are an administrator on.
21. On your network, there are multiple systems that users need to access, such as a Windows domain, a cloud site for storage, and order processing software. You want to configure the network such that users do not need to remember separate usernames or passwords for each site; their login credentials will be good for different systems. Which technology should you use?

    1. EFS
    2. MDM
    3. SSO
    4. UAC

    Answer:

    C. One of the big problems larger networks must deal with is the need for users to access multiple systems or applications. This may require a user to remember multiple accounts and passwords. The purpose of single sign-on (SSO) is to give users access to all the applications and systems that they need when they log on. Some of the systems may require users to enter their credentials again, but the username and password will be consistent between systems. EFS is the Encrypting File System used to encrypt volumes, files, and folders in Windows OSs. MDM is mobile device management, which allows an IT department to retain some control even though users employ BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). UAC is user account control, which verifies that someone has the authority to change a Windows system before making any changes.
22. A user discovers a strange text file at the root of their user directory. It contains everything they have typed over the past few days, including their credentials. What is the likely cause of the text file?

    1. System auditing enabled
    2. Keylogger installed
    3. Email application in debug mode
    4. Backup file

    Answer:

    B. A keylogger seems to be running on the system, monitoring and copying all that is typed on the keyboard. Obviously, this malware needs to be removed and incident response steps taken.
23. What security solution would protect a user from unwanted network traffic probing their workstation?

    1. Software firewall
    2. Antiphishing training
    3. Anti-malware
    4. Antivirus

    Answer:

    A. A software-based firewall on the workstation would be able to stop unwanted network traffic, including port scans and probes. Antiphishing training teaches users to avoid malicious emails. Anti-malware and antivirus are software designed to recognize and quarantine or eradicate malicious code.
24. A user wants to use multifactor authentication at their PC but does not want to carry a key fob and is strongly against biometrics. What method can you suggest?

    1. Second password
    2. Hardware token
    3. Software token
    4. Fingerprint reader

    Answer:

    C. The software token is stored on a general-purpose device, such as the PC or a smartphone. The hardware token option would involve carrying an added key fob or device. A fingerprint reader would be unacceptable as it involves biometrics. A second password defeats the benefit of using multifactor authentication.
25. What wireless protocol used in WPA compensates for the weak encryption of WEP?

    1. VLAN
    2. TKIP
    3. VPN
    4. AES

    Answer:

    B. Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is an encryption protocol, used in WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) for wireless connections. It was intended to replace WEP's weak encryption by creating a unique key for each for each data frame. It has since been subject to wireless attacks and is not considered acceptable for big business. A VLAN (virtual LAN) occurs when devices from multiple LANs are joined together virtually and can act as if they are on the same physical network even though they are not. A VPN (virtual private network) is similar because it creates a private tunnel through a public network using encryption protocols. A VPN might be used by someone working remotely to access a corporate server. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the successor to TKIP. AES and TKIP work together in WPA2 (WPA, version 2).
26. Which of the following Active Directory concepts can help enforce security settings? (Choose two.)

    1. EFS
    2. Group Policy/updates
    3. Port security
    4. Login scripts

    Answer:

    B, D. Group Policy/updates and login scripts are common ways to push and enforce security settings on Active Directory objects. EFS is the Encrypting File System, which is used to encrypt volumes, files, and folders. Port security means opening or closing ports on a router to control what type of packets traverse the router.
27. What 128-bit block encryption that uses an encryption key of 128, 192, or 256 bits is used in WPA2 and is more secure than TKIP?

    1. AES
    2. VPN
    3. RADIUS
    4. Kerberos

    Answer:

    A. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used in WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access, version 2). VPN is a virtual private network that transmits data across a public network using encryption. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) and Kerberos are both authentication protocols.
28. What protocol was designed to authenticate remote users to a dial-in access server?

    1. TKIP
    2. TACACS+
    3. VPN
    4. RADIUS

    Answer:

    D. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service) was originally designed to authenticate remote users to a dial-in access server but is now used in several authentication situations. TKIP is a wireless encryption protocol used in WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) which made WPA more robust/secure than WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System) is an authentication protocol for centralized authentication, and a VPN (virtual private network) uses encryption to create a private connection using a public network.
29. A user is complaining that they can no longer sign into their account because of too many bad attempts. What basic Active Directory function is at work here?

    1. Failed login attempts restrictions
    2. Antivirus/anti-malware
    3. A bollard
    4. A rootkit

    Answer:

    A. Using Active Directory settings or the Local Group Policy Editor, you can restrict the number of failed login attempts before the user is locked out of their account. This is important to help prevent a brute-force attack, which attempts to guess passwords until it hits upon the right one. Antivirus/anti-malware is important to have and identifies malicious software based on its signature code but is not at work here. A bollard is a physical post to block vehicular traffic, and a rootkit is a particularly difficult malware to eradicate because it is working with administrator rights and it's good at hiding in a system.
30. What concept in Active Directory creates a directory subdivision within which may be placed users, groups, computers and other objects?

    1. User
    2. Domain
    3. Organizational unit
    4. Home folder

    Answer:

    C. The organizational unit (OU) is a subdivision within which may be placed users, groups, more OUs, and other objects. The OU exists on a domain, which is a group of users and resources under a single administrative control. Windows domains are managed by software called Active Directory. Active Directory is organized into organizational units, usually for security purposes. A home folder is where an individual user stores their documents and such, and in a Windows domain, that location is usually on the domain controller or another server.
31. Which of the following authentication encryption protocols is older than the others and was developed by Cisco but became an open protocol in the 1990s and can be found on Linux distributions?

    1. AES
    2. TACACS+
    3. Kerberos
    4. RADIUS

    Answer:

    B. TACACS+ is an authentication protocol developed by Cisco that is now an open standard. It separates the AAA (authentication, authorization, and accounting) packets and encrypts them. It was released in 1993 and RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is an authentication protocol that was released in 1997. Kerberos is an open source authentication protocol that has been around since the 1980s. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is for wireless encryption and not authentication, has been around since 2001 and is the successor to TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
32. Your data center recently experienced a theft of a server from the rack. Which security mechanisms would protect servers from future theft? (Choose two.)

    1. Equipment locks
    2. Security token
    3. Alarm systems
    4. Hard token

    Answer:

    A, C. An equipment lock would slow down a would-be thief, and alarm systems often send thieves looking for an easier mark. A security token is involved in multifactor authentication, and a hard token is one of two types of security tokens, the other being a soft token.
33. What other security devices are often employed in an access control vestibule? (Choose two.)

    1. Bollard
    2. Motion sensors
    3. Guards
    4. Video surveillance

    Answer:

    C, D. Often an access control vestibule will have either a security guard, or video surveillance, or both. Once in the vestibule the second door could be opened remotely by someone watching through the surveillance camera or by a guard who personally clears the person trying to gain access. A bollard is a post used to block vehicular traffic. A motion sensor detects movement and is often used to trigger an alarm, turn on a light, or turn on a camera, or a combination of those.
34. Normally, a company places a user's profile and folders on the local machine. Now, the organization would like a few users to be able to log in from other computers. What concept in Active Directory allows a user's profile folders to be placed in storage somewhere else on the network?

    1. Home folder
    2. Folder redirection
    3. Organizational unit
    4. VPN

    Answer:

    B. Folder redirection allows users' profile folders to be stored off a local machine and instead placed in a more centralized location on the network. A profile stored this way is called a roaming profile. The home folder is the specific location where a user's documents and such are stored. An organizational unit is a management tool that can be used to organize Active Directory resources and can contain users, computers, and other resources. A VPN (virtual private network) is created across a public network by using strong encryption protocols.
35. What wireless encryption protocol replaced WPA and uses both TKIP, for backward compatibility, and AES?

    1. WEP
    2. WPA2
    3. WPA3
    4. RADIUS

    Answer:

    B. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access, version 2) replaced WPA, which had replaced WEP (Wired Equivalency Protocol). WEP was the first wireless security protocol. WPA, which was developed next, used TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), and WPA2 uses TKIP and the more secure AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). WPA3 was released in 2018 to replace WPA2, whose security had been broken. WPA3 also includes better security for the proliferation of IoT devices. WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 all have personal and enterprise options.
36. When should OS and application patches be applied to a system to prevent it from becoming vulnerable?

    1. Every 6 months
    2. Every 3 months
    3. Once a month
    4. As soon as they are available

    Answer:

    D. Operating system (OS) and application patches may fix vulnerabilities in the software and should be applied as soon as possible after they are released. In a corporate environment it would likely be best to test them in a sandbox first to avoid any problems. On a Windows PC, the Windows Update utility is used to manage the process for you.
37. You have a Windows workstation and want to prevent a potential hacker from booting to a USB drive. What should you do to help prevent this?

    1. Require strong Windows passwords.
    2. Restrict with user permissions.
    3. Set a BIOS/UEFI password.
    4. Change the default administrator password.

    Answer:

    C. A strong Windows password, restricting with user permissions, and changing the default administrator password will help protect Windows but does not protect the computer in general. If a user can get into the BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input Output System/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), then they can change the boot sequence, boot to a USB drive, and do some damage to the system. The way to protect against this is to implement a BIOS/UEFI password.
38. Which type of security solution generally functions as a packet filter and can perform stateful inspection?

    1. VPN
    2. EFS
    3. Antivirus/anti-malware
    4. Firewall

    Answer:

    D. Firewalls are among the first lines of defense in a network. They can be hardware firewalls or software firewalls and can exist on several layers of a network. The basic purpose of a firewall is to isolate one network from another or one network node from another. Firewalls function as one or more of the following: packet filter, proxy firewall, or stateful inspection firewall. VPN (virtual private network) creates a private network across a public one by using encryption protocols. EFS (Encrypting File System) is used to encrypt files and folders. Antivirus/anti-malware is used to detect malicious attackers by identifying signature lines of code or actions.
39. Which of the following are examples of physical security methods? (Choose two.)

    1. Biometric locks
    2. Multifactor authentication
    3. Keys
    4. Firewalls

    Answer:

    A, C. Biometric locks use a part of your body as identification. They are considered physical security, as are simple door keys. Multifactor authentication is security that requires identification and two or more methods of authentication, such as a password and key fob. Authentication can be verified by something you know (passwords), something you have (key fob, smartcard), something you are (fingerprint), or somewhere you are (using GPS position or a Wi-Fi network and cell tower triangulation). Firewalls are logical security that filters incoming and outgoing packets to allow or reject them based on criteria you choose.
40. A user on your network reported that they received a phone call from someone in the IT department saying the user needed to reset their password. The caller offered to do it for them if the user could provide the IT worker with their current password. What is this most likely an example of?

    1. The IT department helping the user to reset their password
    2. A spoofing attack
    3. A social engineering attack
    4. A brute-force attack

    Answer:

    C. A person in the IT department is not likely to ask for your password. If they want you to reset it, they can use software to reset it that will make you choose a new password on next login. This is a social engineering attack. Social engineering is using kindness, coercion, or fear to get you to give up privileged information such as your password. Spoofing is when a website or server, for example, is made to look like a trusted one but in reality there is an attacker lurking there. A brute-force attack uses software to repeatedly try different passwords to break into a system.
41. Your corporate IT department has decided that to enhance security they want to draft a mobile device management (MDM) policy to require both a passcode and fingerprint scan to unlock a mobile device for use. What is this an example of?

    1. An authenticator application
    2. Biometric authentication
    3. Full-device encryption
    4. Multifactor authentication

    Answer:

    D. Any time there is more than one authentication method required, it's multifactor authentication (MFA). In this case, it does involve using biometrics, but the passcode is not a biometric factor. An authenticator app can provide a code and be a part of multifactor authentication. Authenticator apps run on a device like a smartphone or PC and provide a unique key that changes every few seconds. The key proves that you have the smartphone or PC in your possession. Full-device encryption could be accomplished with a feature like Microsoft's BitLocker, which encrypts an entire drive including the boot files, or a TPM chip, which prohibits accessing a drive if the chip is not present. Multifactor authentication usually requires two of the following four types of inputs: something you know (password), something you have (smart token), something you are (biometrics), or somewhere you are (GPS or other location services).
42. Several employees at your company have been tailgating to gain access to secure areas. Which of the following security methods is the best choice for stopping this practice?

    1. Door lock
    2. Entry control roster
    3. Access control vestibule
    4. ID badges

    Answer:

    C. Tailgating refers to being so close to someone when they enter a building that you can come in right behind them without needing to use a key, a card, or any other security device. Using an access control vestibule, which is a device such as a small room that limits access to one or a few individuals, is a great way to stop tailgating. With a door lock or ID badge, the tailgaters could still follow the other employee in. An entry control roster is merely a list of people who are allowed access to an area, and it isn't much use without a guard to check it.
43. A user has joined your company as a network administrator. Let's assume their user account name is AOShea. What is the recommended way to give AOShea the administrative privileges they need?

    1. Add the AOShea user account to the Administrators group.
    2. Create an account called AdminAOShea. Add that account to the Administrators group. Have the new administrator use the AOShea account unless they need administrative rights, in which case they should use the AdminAOShea account.
    3. Copy the Administrator account and rename it AOShea.
    4. Add the AOShea user account to the Power Users group.

    Answer:

    B. Adding AOShea to the Administrators group will certainly work, but it's not the recommended approach. Since members of the Administrators group have such power, they can inadvertently do harm (such as accidentally deleting a file that a regular user could not). To protect against this, the practice of logging in with an Administrators group account for daily interaction is strongly discouraged. Instead, system administrators should log in with a user account (lesser privileges) and change to the Administrators group account (elevated privileges) only when necessary.
44. You are designing a security policy for mobile phones on your network. Which of the following is a common method of biometric authentication used with mobile devices?

    1. Fingerprint scan
    2. Retina scan
    3. Swipe lock
    4. DNA lock

    Answer:

    A. Biometric authentication requires identification of a physical feature of the user, such as a fingerprint or palmprint. Mobile devices commonly use your fingerprint to prove who you are. Most modern laptops can also use a facial scan to identify you. DNA and retina scanners are considered a form of biometric authentication, but they're not commonly used today with mobile devices. (Imagine your phone needing to collect blood or saliva to authenticate you—no thanks!) DNA and facial scans aren't on the CompTIA A+ objectives yet, but retina scanners, fingerprint, and palmprint scanners are. A swipe lock is not a type of biometrics.
45. An administrator is transferring confidential files from one Windows Pro workstation to another, using a flash drive. Policy dictates that the files on the flash drive must be encrypted. Which technology should be used?

    1. BitLocker
    2. BitLocker To Go
    3. EFS
    4. AES

    Answer:

    B. BitLocker allows you to use drive encryption to protect files—including those needed for startup and logon. For removable drives, BitLocker To Go provides the same encryption technology to help prevent unauthorized access to the files stored on them. EFS is the Encrypting File System, used to encrypt volumes, files, and folders on a drive. AES is the Advanced Encryption Standard, an encrypting protocol for Wi-Fi.
46. Which type of security system uses physical characteristics to allow or deny access to locations or resources?

    1. ID badges
    2. Bollards
    3. Biometrics
    4. Tokens

    Answer:

    C. Biometric devices use physical characteristics to identify the user. Biometric systems include fingerprint/palm/hand scanners, retinal scanners, face scanners, and soon, possibly, DNA scanners. To gain access to resources, you must pass a physical screening process. Bollards are vertical posts to block vehicular traffic. ID badges often use RFID (radio frequency identification) to communicate with a reader and verify your identity. Tokens can be either hard (like a key fob) or soft (software on a system) and are often used in multifactor authentication.
47. You have just transformed a Windows workgroup into a small domain and are configuring user accounts. Which of the following is considered a best practice for managing user account security?

    1. Require every user to log on as a Guest user.
    2. Allow all users Read and Write access to all server files.
    3. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    4. Place all user accounts in the Administrators group.

    Answer:

    C. When assigning user permissions, follow the principle of least privilege; give users only the bare minimum that they need to do their job, nothing more. Another best practice is to assign permissions to groups rather than users, and make users members of groups (or remove them from groups) as they change roles or positions.
48. A security consultant for your company recommended that you begin shredding or burning classified documents before disposing of them. What security risk is the consultant trying to protect the company from?

    1. Shoulder surfing
    2. Dumpster diving
    3. Social engineering
    4. Brute-force attack

    Answer:

    B. Companies normally generate a huge amount of paper, most of which eventually winds up in dumpsters or recycle bins. Dumpsters may contain information that is highly sensitive in nature, and attackers may seek it out by practicing dumpster diving. In high-security and government environments, sensitive papers should be either shredded or burned. Shoulder surfing is literally looking over someone's shoulder to try to see passwords or other sensitive information. Social engineering happens any time someone tries to coerce, threaten, or cajole someone into giving up privileged security information. A brute-force attack is repeatedly trying passwords in an effort to guess the correct one.
49. Several workstations on your network have not had their operating systems updated in more than a year, and your antivirus software is also out-of-date. What type of security threat does this represent?

    1. Non-compliant systems
    2. Zombie/botnet
    3. Brute-force attack
    4. Zero-day attack

    Answer:

    A. The systems are not up-to-date and therefore are more vulnerable to attacks. These systems are considered noncompliant systems. It's a violation of security best practices to fail to keep all software on your network up-to-date. Zombie and botnet are attacks where the user of the computer doesn't know there is malware on their computer. Their computer is a zombie, and when many zombies are used to attack a system, it's known as a botnet attack. A brute-force attack usually involves software that keeps trying passwords or codes until it hits upon the right one to gain access. A zero-day attack happens when a hole is found in a web browser or other software and attackers begin exploiting it the very day it is discovered by the developer, before they have time to plug the hole.
50. On the Internet, you get a news flash that the developer of one of your core applications found a security flaw. They will issue a patch for it in two days. Before you can install the patch, it's clear that the flaw has been exploited and someone has illegally accessed your network. What type of attack is this?

    1. Zombie/botnet
    2. Non-compliant system
    3. Zero-day attack
    4. Brute-force attack

    Answer:

    C. When a hole is found in a web browser or other software and attackers begin exploiting it the very day it is discovered by the developer (bypassing the one- to two-day response time that many software providers need to put out a patch once the hole has been found), it is known as a zero-day attack (or exploit). Zombie and botnet are attacks where the user of the computer doesn't know there is malware on their computer. Their computer is a zombie, and when many zombies are used to attack a system, it's known as a botnet attack. Noncompliant systems are those whose software is not up-to-date or they are not following best practices or corporate restrictions and rules. A brute-force attack usually involves software that keeps trying passwords or codes until it hits upon the right one to gain access.
51. UserA is a member of the Dev group and the HR group. They are trying to access a local resource on an NTFS volume. The HR group has Full Control permission for the `payroll` folder, and the Dev group has Deny Read permission for the same folder. What is UserA's effective access to the `payroll` folder?

    1. Full Control
    2. Read
    3. Write
    4. Deny

    Answer:

    D. When there are conflicting NTFS permissions, generally they are combined, and the most liberal is granted. The exception to that is when there is an explicit Deny. That overrides any allowed permissions.
52. Which default Windows group was designed to have more power than normal users but not as much power as administrators, and is now kept for backward compatibility only?

    1. Superuser
    2. Standard Users
    3. Power Users
    4. Advanced Users

    Answer:

    C. Microsoft wanted to create a group in Windows that was powerful but not as powerful as the Administrators group, which is how the Power Users group came into being. The idea was that membership in this group would be given Read/Write permission to the system, allowing members to install most software but keeping them from changing key operating system files or accessing other users' data. However, for many current Windows versions, the Power Users group now is assigned permissions equivalent to the Standard user, a member of the Users group. There is no group called Superuser, or Standard Users, or Advanced Users.
53. You have assigned a Windows workstation to a workgroup. Which of the following are recommended best practices for maximizing security regarding the Administrator account? (Choose two.)

    1. Disable the Administrator account.
    2. Rename the Administrator account.
    3. Remove the Administrator account from the Administrators group.
    4. Require a strong password.

    Answer:

    B, D. You should rename the default Administrator account and always require strong passwords.
54. You're at home using a digital security method to connect to your corporate network. This security method wraps data in encryption (encapsulating it) to transfer the data across a public network (the Internet), and your connection gets a corporate IP address just as if you were sitting in the office. What type of connection is this?

    1. VPN
    2. Firewall
    3. BitLocker
    4. EFS

    Answer:

    A. A virtual private network (VPN) is a private network connection that occurs through a public network. VPNs make use of tunneling, which sends private data across a public network by placing (encapsulating) that data into other packets. Even though a VPN is created through the Internet or other public networks, the connection logically appears to be part of the local network, although the connection will likely be a bit slower than sitting at a PC in the office. A firewall is used to filter packets, blocking or accepting them based on the port number they use, MAC address, or other criteria. BitLocker is a full-drive encryption utility. EFS (Encrypting File System) is used to encrypt volumes, individual files, and folders.
55. Which of the following are advantages of using NTFS permissions over using share permissions? (Choose two.)

    1. NTFS permissions will override share permissions if there is a conflict.
    2. NTFS permissions affect users at the local computer, but share permissions do not.
    3. NTFS permissions are more restrictive in their access levels than share permissions.
    4. NTFS permissions can be set at the file level, but share permissions cannot.

    Answer:

    B, D. NTFS permissions affect users regardless of whether they are at the local computer or accessing the resource across a network. They can also be applied to individual files, whereas share permissions can be applied only to folders. One set of permissions is not inherently more restrictive than the other, as either type can be used to deny access in a given situation (at least when accessing across the network). When NTFS and share permissions affect the same folders, the most restrictive permission applies.
56. Someone has placed an unauthorized wireless router on your network and configured it with the same SSID as your network. Users can access the network through that router, even though it's not supposed to be there. What type of security threat could this lead to?

    1. Zombie/botnet
    2. Spoofing
    3. Non-compliant system
    4. On-path attack

    Answer:

    D. An unauthorized router with a seemingly legitimate configuration is specifically known as an evil twin. Those can lead to on-path attacks, which involve clandestinely placing something (such as a piece of software or a rogue router) between a server and the user, and neither the server's administrator nor the user is aware of it. The unauthorized device in the middle intercepts data and then sends the information to the server as if nothing is wrong. The unauthorized device software may be recording information for someone to view later, altering it, or in some other way compromising the security of your system and session.
57. Which type of security method is worn by employees and usually has a picture on it?

    1. Key fobs
    2. ID badges
    3. Smartcards
    4. Biometrics

    Answer:

    B. An ID badge is worn by employees to identify them. Some companies use different colored badges to indicate different functions or security privileges. Most ID badges have a picture of the user on them to prevent unauthorized use. Key fobs are small devices that generate a code that changes every few seconds and are often used in multifactor authentication. Smartcards will have either an RFID tag or a chip that can be read by a reader device to allow or deny entrance to an area. Biometrics are any type of identification that uses a part of your body to identify you.
58. You're working at a high-security server farm and must ensure that vehicles stay a certain distance away from the building. What physical security methods can be used for this purpose? (Choose two.)

    1. Bollards
    2. Motion sensors
    3. Fences
    4. Lighting

    Answer:

    A, C. Bollards are vertical posts that are short and sturdy, sometimes made of cement or steel. They can be placed closely enough together so that a vehicle can't go through an area but people can. Fences can also be erected to keep vehicles and people out of an area. Motion sensors can be used to trigger alarms but won't actually keep anyone out, and good lighting is always a deterrent, but again it won't physically keep anyone out.
59. Between you and your family members, there are several mobile devices, including phones, laptops and smart watches. Someone generally forgets where they put their phone, or it may be stolen, and it would be nice to easily find it. In addition, you want to see where other family members are when they are around town. Which type of app will allow you to do this?

    1. Trusted source app
    2. Remote control app
    3. Locator app
    4. Firewall app

    Answer:

    C. A locator app is what you need. Apple supplies a free app called Find My, and Google has Find My Device that, together with their respective websites, allow multiple mobile devices and to be located if powered on and attached to the Internet (via 5G, 4G, 3G, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and so on). For Apple devices, if not attached to the Internet, nearby devices can identify your device and tell you where it is. Both Find My and Find My Device allow the device to be controlled remotely to lock it, play a sound (even if audio is off), display a message, or wipe the device clean.
60. Which security mechanism specifies permissions for users and groups as well as the type of activities the users or groups can perform?

    1. ACL
    2. EFS
    3. VPN
    4. PIN

    Answer:

    A. File systems such as NTFS, and security devices such as firewalls, can specify security by using access control lists (ACLs). ACLs can hold permissions for local users and groups, and each entry in the ACL can also specify what type of access is given. This allows a great deal of flexibility in setting up a network. EFS is the Encrypting File System used to encrypt volumes, files, and folders, but not entire drives. VPN is a type of network connection that uses encryption to create a private network that traverses a public one. PINs (personal identification numbers) are used in many applications to identify a user.
61. You need to know which files have been modified in a folder. Which of the following is not a way to see when files have been modified?

    1. Right-click each file and choose Properties, and then Advanced to see whether the archive bit is set.
    2. Open the folder in File Explorer and click Date Modified to sort the files by the date they were last modified.
    3. Type **`archive`** at a command prompt.
    4. Type **`attrib`** at a command prompt.

    Answer:

    C. On any individual file or folder you can right-click and choose Properties to see the Read-only and Hidden attributes, then click Advanced to see whether the file is ready for archiving (needs to be backed up). You can also open a folder in File Explorer and click Date Modified to sort the files by the last date modified. Simply typing **`attrib`** at a command prompt will show the file attributes for everything in that folder. Attributes are information such as whether the file is a system file (S), hidden (H), read only (R), or ready to be archived (A). To see the attributes for a single file, type **`attrib`** _**`filename`**_. The `attrib` command is not in the CompTIA A+ objectives, but file attributes are.
62. You want to create a new policy to encrypt all company drives using BitLocker. Which operating system will need to be upgraded?

    1. Windows 10 Pro
    2. Windows 11 Home
    3. Windows 11 Pro
    4. Windows 10 for Workstations

    Answer:

    B. Professional and higher operating system editions in either Windows 10 or Windows 11 will support BitLocker. Home editions will not, regardless of what version of the Windows operating system they are.
63. Software was installed on a laptop without the user's knowledge. The software has been tracking the user's keystrokes and has transmitted the user's credit card information to an attacker. What type of threat is this?

    1. Zombie/botnet
    2. Spoofing
    3. Spyware
    4. Ransomware

    Answer:

    C. Spyware differs from other malware in that it works—often actively—on behalf of a third party. Rather than self-replicating, like viruses and worms, spyware is spread to machines by users who inadvertently ask for it. The users often don't know they have asked for it but have done so by downloading other programs, visiting infected sites, and so on. The spyware program monitors the user's activity and responds by offering unsolicited pop-up advertisements (sometimes known as adware), gathers information about the user to pass on to marketers, or intercepts personal data such as credit card numbers. Zombies and botnets are innocent computers that are used to perpetrate an attack on someone else without the user's knowledge. An example of spoofing is using an IP address that should be someone else and pretending to be them to gain access to a system. Ransomware locks a system in some way or encrypts data and won't allow access until the system's owner pays a ransom.
64. A new user has joined your company as a network administrator. Which of the following statements is most correct regarding their network access?

    1. They should have just one user account, with administrator-level permissions.
    2. They should have just one user account, with standard user-level permissions.
    3. They should have two user accounts: one with user-level permissions and one with administrator-level permissions.
    4. They should have three user accounts: one with user-level permissions, one with administrator-level permissions, and one with remote access administrator permissions.

    Answer:

    C. The new administrator should have a nonadministrative account to use for day-to-day tasks. They also need an account with administrative privileges to perform the administrative duties. When creating user accounts, follow the principle of least privilege: give users only the permissions they need to do their work and no more. This is especially true with administrators. Those users should be educated on how each of the accounts should be used.
65. Which types of security threats are direct attacks on user passwords? (Choose two.)

    1. Brute-force
    2. Zombie/botnet
    3. Dictionary attack
    4. Spoofing

    Answer:

    A, C. Password attacks occur when an account is attacked repeatedly with the intent of determining the password that will gain access. This is accomplished by using applications designed to break the password by sending possible passwords to the account in a systematic manner. Two types of password attacks are brute-force and dictionary attacks. Zombie and botnet are attacks where the user of the computer doesn't know there is malware on their computer. Their computer is a zombie, and when many zombies are used to attack a system, it's known as a botnet attack. A spoofing attack is an attempt by someone or something to masquerade as someone else.
66. You read corporate email on your smartphone and do not want others to access the phone if you leave it somewhere. What is the first layer of security that you should implement to keep others from using your phone?

    1. Multifactor authentication
    2. Full-device encryption
    3. Screen lock
    4. Remote wipe software

    Answer:

    C. All the options will increase the security of a smartphone. For just the basic level of security, though, enable a screen lock. A user will need to enter a code to gain access to the device. It's typically enough to thwart casual snoops and would-be hackers. Multifactor authentication occurs whenever you need two or more ways to prove who you are (something you know, something you have, something you are, or someplace you are). Full-device encryption would mean encoding the data and requiring a key to decrypt it. Remote wipe is a feature that can be used to remove all the personal or corporate data from a phone even though it is lost or stolen.
67. You use your smartphone for email and extensive Internet browsing. You want to add an additional level of security to always verify your identity online when accessing various accounts. Which type of app do you need?

    1. Authenticator app
    2. Trusted source app
    3. Biometric authenticator app
    4. Account encryption app

    Answer:

    A. An authenticator app can help securely verify your identity online, regardless of the account you want to log into. Different apps work in different ways, but the general procedure is that the app will generate a random code for you to type along with your username and password. The random code helps identify you and tells the site you are logging into that you really are who you say you are. The other options are not actual application types.
68. You have instructed users on your network to not use common words for their passwords. What type of attack are you trying to prevent?

    1. Brute-force
    2. Dictionary attack
    3. Social engineering
    4. Shoulder surfing

    Answer:

    B. A dictionary attack uses a dictionary of common words to attempt to find the user's password. Dictionary attacks can be automated, and several tools exist in the public domain to execute them. As an example of this type of attack, imagine guessing words and word combinations found in a standard English-language dictionary. The policy you have recommended could also help thwart those who may try to look over a shoulder (shoulder surfing) to see a user's password because even with a quick glance they can see whether or not it's a common word. Brute-force is trying repeatedly to guess a user's password. Social engineering is using kindness, coercion, or fear to get you to give up privileged information such as your password.
69. Which type of malware is designed to look like a different program and, when installed, creates a back door for an attacker to access the target system?

    1. Trojan
    2. Spyware
    3. Virus
    4. Whaling

    Answer:

    A. Trojans are programs that enter a system or network under the guise of another program. A Trojan may be included as an attachment or as part of an installation program. The Trojan can create a back door or replace a valid program during installation. It then accomplishes its mission under the guise of another program. A Trojan is named after the Trojan horse of mythology. Spyware watches what you do and reports back to someone. A virus is spread from computer to computer because of some contact between the machines, often through email. Whaling is phishing for “big fish,” such as very wealthy or influential people. Phishing gets its name from fishing for information.
70. You have been asked to dispose of several old magnetic hard drives. What are you doing if you use a large magnet to clear the data off a hard drive?

    1. Overwriting
    2. Zero writing
    3. Degaussing
    4. Incineration

    Answer:

    C. A large electromagnet can be used to destroy any magnetic media, such as a hard drive or backup tape set. The most common of these is the degaussing tool. Degaussing involves applying a strong magnetic field to initialize the media. This process helps ensure that information doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Overwriting and zero writing write random binary (or all zeros) on a magnetic hard drive using software. The process must be done several times by the software to be effective. Incineration means simply burning the drive.
71. If you check the Read-only or Hidden box on the graphic, what feature of the folder is being changed?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c07uf001_0.jpg" alt="" height="1000" width="783"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Archive bit
    2. NTFS permissions
    3. Attributes
    4. Share permissions

    Answer:

    C. Certain metadata pertaining to a file are called attributes. The most commonly used attributes are system (S), hidden (H), read only (R), and archive (A). There is a list of others that can be viewed by typing **`attrib /?`** at a command prompt. The `attrib` command can be used to view or add attributes, such as entering **`attrib myfile +R`** to make _`myfile`_ read only. You can remove the read only attribute using the same command with a minus sign instead of a plus sign. In the Windows 10/11 GUI, view attributes by right-clicking a file or folder and choosing Properties. Windows 11 will display a screen like the one in the graphic. More attributes can be seen by clicking the Advanced button as seen in the graphic. The `attrib` command is not on the CompTIA A+ objectives, but file attributes are.
72. You're setting up a Windows 11 Pro machine and want to encrypt the entire hard drive, including startup files. Which technology best meets your needs?

    1. Windows OSs do not allow full-drive encryption.
    2. BitLocker
    3. BitLocker to Go
    4. EFS

    Answer:

    B. BitLocker Drive Encryption allows you to use drive encryption to protect files—including those needed for startup and logon. This is available only with Windows Pro and higher editions. For removable drives, BitLocker To Go provides the same encryption technology to help prevent unauthorized access to the files stored on them. EFS (Encrypting File System) is used to encrypt volumes, files, and folders but is not capable of encrypting the entire drive.
73. Which type of security threat gains administrative-level access for an attacker to perform another attack, and then hides its presence from system management tools?

    1. Virus
    2. Whaling
    3. Rootkit
    4. Ransomware

    Answer:

    C. Rootkits are software programs that can hide certain things from the operating system; they do so by obtaining (and retaining) administrative-level access. With a rootkit, there may be several processes running on a system that don't show in Task Manager, or connections that don't appear in a `netstat` display may be established or available—the rootkit masks the presence of these items. Rootkits are known for being particularly difficult to eradicate. A virus is spread from computer to computer because of some contact between the machines, often through email. Whaling is phishing for “big fish,” such as very wealthy or influential people. Phishing gets its name from fishing for information. Ransomware holds a machine or network hostage, making it and its data inaccessible, until a ransom is paid.
74. A computer user wants to encrypt a few files on an NTFS volume on their Windows Pro workstation. They do not have administrative rights to the computer. Which of the following statements is correct?

    1. They can only use device encryption.
    2. They can use BitLocker.
    3. They can use BitLocker To Go.
    4. They can use EFS.

    Answer:

    D. Encrypting File System (EFS) is available in most editions of Windows, and it allows for encryption/decryption of files stored in NTFS volumes. All users can use EFS, whereas only administrators can turn on BitLocker. It does not require any special hardware, while BitLocker benefits from having the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). As an additional distinction, EFS can encrypt just one file, if so desired, while BitLocker encrypts the whole volume and whatever is stored on it.
75. Which type of digital security is designed to protect your network from malicious software programs by both preventing them from entering the system and removing them if they are found?

    1. Firewall
    2. Anti-malware
    3. EFS
    4. UAC

    Answer:

    B. Anti-malware software will help protect computers from malicious programs. Typically, anti-malware does everything that antivirus software does as well as identify threats beyond just viruses. In fact, viruses are a type of malware. A lot of anti-malware software is marketed as antivirus software. A firewall is a hardware or software device designed to prevent certain types of traffic from entering or leaving a network. EFS (Encrypting File System) allows a user to encrypt individual volumes, files, or folders, and UAC (User Account Control) is designed to prevent users from making changes that they are not authorized to make.
76. Your company has hired a consultant to intentionally send emails asking for login information from your employees. What is your company engaging in?

    1. Phishing
    2. Whaling
    3. Zero-day attack
    4. Anti-phishing training

    Answer:

    D. Educating users to recognize phishing is one of the most important steps in preventing hackers from acquiring login credentials. One way to do this is to hire a consulting company to send phishing emails and see which employees respond when they should not and need additional training. Phishing is usually done through email and is an attempt to “fish” for information from an authorized network user such as logon information. Whaling is phishing for high-profile or wealthy targets. A zero-day attack is one that happens the same day a vulnerability is discovered, so there has not been time to rectify the vulnerability.
77. On a Windows workstation, there is one volume formatted with NTFS. The Developers group has Modify access to the `C:\dev` directory. You copy the folder to the `C:\operations` folder, to which the Developers group has Read access. What level of permissions will the Developers group have to the new `C:\operations\dev` directory?

    1. Read & Execute
    2. Read
    3. Full Control
    4. Modify

    Answer:

    B. When a file or folder is copied on NTFS volumes, the new file or folder will inherit its NTFS permissions from its new parent folder. The old permissions will be discarded. However, when files and folders are moved versus copying them, the original permissions are retained at the new location.
78. You are configuring NTFS and share permissions on a Windows 11 workstation. Which of the following statements is true regarding permissions?

    1. Both NTFS and share permissions can be applied only at the folder level.
    2. NTFS permissions can be applied at the file or folder level, and share permissions can only be applied at the folder level.
    3. NTFS permissions can be applied only at the folder level, but share permissions can be applied to files and folders
    4. Both NTFS and share permissions support inheritance.

    Answer:

    B. Only NTFS permissions can be applied to individual files. Both NTFS and share permissions can be applied to volumes and folders. Share permissions are only effective when the resource is accessed via a network. NTFS permissions are effective whether the person accesses the resource locally or via a network. NTFS permissions are inherited from a parent folder. Share permissions do not have inheritance.
79. Which type of security device displays a randomly generated code that the user enters for access to computer resources?

    1. ID badge
    2. RFID badge
    3. Smartcard
    4. Key fob

    Answer:

    D. A key fob is a small device about the size that could usually be carried on a key chain. They generate a random number every few seconds that can be used for multifactor identification to gain access to a secure system such as a bank account. Key fobs are also a type of hard token. The other three choices—ID badge, RFID badge, and smartcard—are all something that can be carried by an employee to gain access to an area. Smartcards or RFID badges store electronic information that could be used to access equipment as well. Information on them is accessed by devices called readers.
80. You recently noticed a change on your computer. Now when you open your web browser, no matter what you search for, you get a dozen unsolicited pop-up windows offering to sell you items you didn't ask for. What type of problem does your computer have?

    1. Spyware
    2. Ransomware
    3. Zombie/botnet
    4. Trojan

    Answer:

    A. Spyware differs from other malware in that it works—often actively—on behalf of a third party. Rather than self-replicating, like viruses and worms, spyware is spread to machines by users who inadvertently ask for it. The users often don't know they have asked for it but have done so by downloading other programs, visiting infected sites, and so on. The spyware program monitors the user's activity and responds by offering unsolicited pop-up advertisements (sometimes known as adware), gathers information about the user to pass on to marketers, or intercepts personal data such as credit card numbers. Ransomware is software that takes over a computer and won't allow access to the data until a ransom is paid. Zombies are computers that have been taken over by another party and are used to perform malicious acts. When there are many zombies acting together, they form a botnet. The computer user is generally unaware of the presence of the attacker. A Trojan is software that is downloaded when the user downloads an innocent-looking software program or digital image. Once downloaded, the Trojan loads into the computer system.
81. A computer user wants to encrypt the data on their Windows 10 Home device. They have administrative rights to the computer. Which of the following statements is correct?

    1. They may be able to use Windows device encryption.
    2. They can use BitLocker.
    3. They can use BitLocker To Go.
    4. They can use EFS.

    Answer:

    A. Encrypting File System (EFS) allows for encryption/decryption of individual volumes, files, and folders stored in NTFS volumes, whereas BitLocker encrypts entire drives, but neither of them is available in Home editions of Windows. If there is supporting hardware (Trusted Platform Module \[TPM] enabled in BIOS/UEFI and Secure Boot enabled), then device encryption can be used instead. With device encryption, only someone with authorization to use the device will be able to decrypt it. You must be logged in as an administrator to turn on device encryption; go to Start, choose Settings, then select Update & Security, and then select Device Encryption. If the option isn't there, then device encryption isn't available on the device. You can also see if the hardware supports it by launching the System Information utility as an administrator, then scrolling down to Device Encryption Support.
82. Which of the following is true about the permissions shown in the graphic? (Choose two.)

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c07uf002_0.jpg" alt="" height="932" width="749"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. They are only in effect when accessed via a network.
    2. They are NTFS permissions.
    3. This type can be used on files and folders.
    4. Everyone can read files inside this folder.

    Answer:

    A, D. These are share permissions. Share permissions have no effect when someone logs on locally; they only take effect when being accessed via a network. (NTFS permissions apply whether logging on locally or via the network.) Share permissions can only be applied to folders, not individual files. The only share permission set on this folder is that Everyone can read it. No one has permission to change it.
83. Which of the following statements are true regarding file and folder attributes on a Windows 11 workstation? (Choose two.)

    1. File attributes are available only on NTFS volumes.
    2. Only members of the Administrators group can change file/folder attributes.
    3. Attributes can be accessed by right-clicking the file/folder and choosing Properties and then selecting the General tab.
    4. Compression is an advanced file/folder attribute.

    Answer:

    C, D. File attributes are accessed in the same manner whether you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11. In the GUI, attributes are accessed by right-clicking the object and choosing Properties and then selecting the General tab. For some attributes, such as compression and encryption, you need to click Advanced in the Attributes section of the General tab. Compression uses algorithms to remove repeated characters and excess spaces, making files take up less space. The user does not need to be an administrator to change attributes. In addition to right-clicking the object, attributes can be changed using the `attrib` command.
84. Which type of digital security needs to have constant updates to best protect your network or computer?

    1. Antivirus
    2. Firewall
    3. Access control list
    4. NTFS permissions

    Answer:

    A. Antivirus software needs continual updates of virus signatures as new viruses are unleashed daily. The updates are known as definition files and ensure that the antivirus engine will recognize new viruses. Firewalls can be software or hardware and are designed to block or allow network traffic based on certain criteria. Once established, settings are not often changed. ACLs (access control lists) are tied to objects in a system and are compared to an authenticated user's information to determine whether to grant access. These too are seldom changed once they are configured. NTFS permissions are part of what creates ACLs. NTFS permissions for an object are granted to a user and can include Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, Read, and Write. Share permissions also affect access to a resource but only when a user accesses it via a network.
85. You are at work and receive a phone call. The caller ID indicates it's coming from your manager's desk. You can see your manager's desk and no one is sitting there. Which of the following is likely happening?

    1. Zombie/botnet attack
    2. Impersonation attack
    3. Zero-day attack
    4. Phishing attack

    Answer:

    B. Impersonation is an attempt by someone or something to masquerade as someone else. You might think of impersonation attacks as affecting network systems, but they can affect phone systems as well. A zombie is a computer system that a hacker has a back door into and can use to perpetrate attacks, unknown to the computer system's legitimate user. A botnet is a system of zombie computers engaged in an orchestrated attack on a target. A zero-day attack occurs when a vulnerability is used to attack a system on the very day that the vulnerability is discovered, before preventive measures to block the vulnerability have been able to be created. In a phishing attack, the attacker uses coercion or other means to attempt to gain passwords or other privileged information.
86. A user is working on a Windows workstation. Their user account is a member of the Managers group, and they are trying to access a folder named `reports`, located on a different computer. The NTFS permissions for the `reports` shared folder on that computer for the Managers group are Read and Write. The folder's share permissions for the Managers group is the Read permission. What are the user's effective permissions on the `reports` folder?

    1. Full Control
    2. Read and Write
    3. Read
    4. No access

    Answer:

    C. Because the user is accessing the NTFS-based resource over the network, both NTFS and share permissions are applied. If there is a difference between the two of them, the most restrictive permissions are used. Therefore, the user has Read access only.
87. Which NTFS permission overrides all the others?

    1. Full Control
    2. Deny
    3. List Folder Contents
    4. Read

    Answer:

    B. Regardless of what other permissions may be granted, Deny will override all of them and the effective permission will be Deny.
88. A system administrator is concerned about Windows users inadvertently installing malware from DVD-ROMs and USB thumb drives that contain malicious code. What can they do to help prevent this from happening?

    1. Set restrictive user permissions.
    2. Enable BIOS/UEFI passwords.
    3. Disable AutoRun and AutoPlay.
    4. Enable data encryption.

    Answer:

    C. Disable AutoRun and AutoPlay should be selected on computers connected to the network. (It is never a good idea to put any media in a workstation if you don't know where it came from or what it is). The simple reason is that the media (CD, DVD, USB, SD) could contain malware. Compounding matters, the malware could be referenced in the `autorun.inf` file, causing it to be summoned when the media is inserted in the machine and requiring no other action. User permissions are not effective on optical drives whose content changes all the time. A BIOS/UEFI password would prevent the computer from being booted, and enabling data encryption can't be done on media that is subject to change.
89. Someone has placed an unauthorized wireless router on your network and configured it with the same SSID as your network. Users can access the network through that router, even though it's not supposed to be there. What is this router configuration known as?

    1. Zombie/botnet
    2. Evil twin
    3. Non-compliant system
    4. On-path attack

    Answer:

    B. An unauthorized router with a seemingly legitimate configuration is specifically known as an evil twin. Those can lead to on-path attacks, which involve clandestinely placing something (such as a piece of software or a rogue router) between a server and the user, and neither the server's administrator nor the user is aware of it. The on-path attacker intercepts data and then sends the information to the server as if nothing is wrong. The on-path attacker's software may be recording information for someone to view later, altering it, or in some other way compromising the security of your system and session. A zombie is a computer system that a hacker has a back door into and can use to perpetrate attacks, unknown to the computer system's legitimate user. A botnet is a system of zombie computers engaged in an orchestrated attack on a target. A noncompliant system is one that is not updated or not following company protocols regarding security.
90. Which of the following is true about the information shown in the graphic? (Choose two.)

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c07uf003_0.jpg" alt="" height="1000" width="716"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. The graphic shows share permissions.
    2. The graphic shows NTFS permissions.
    3. These permissions will be inherited by any folder created on the C drive.
    4. These permissions are only effective when someone accesses them over a network.

    Answer:

    B, C. These are NTFS permissions. They will be inherited by any folder created inside this folder, which happens to be the root of the C: drive. NTFS permissions are effective regardless of whether the user accesses them locally or over a network. (Share permissions are only effective when the resource is accessed via a network, they can only be applied to folders, and share permissions are not inherited.) Inheritance in NTFS is enabled by default but can be disabled by clicking the Advanced button (in the figure) and selecting Disable inheritance.
91. Your office has recently experienced several laptop thefts. Which security mechanism, as pictured in the graphic, is designed to protect mobile devices from theft?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c07uf004_0.jpg" alt="" height="967" width="650"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Security token
    2. Laptop lock
    3. Key fob
    4. Magnetometer

    Answer:

    B. Locks and keys are some of the simplest yet effective physical security measures. The device shown in the graphic is a laptop lock. The user has a key to unlock the device. The heavy cable is looped around something solid like a table leg, and the end where the key is inserted locks into a special slot in a laptop or other mobile device. Security tokens can be either soft tokens or hard tokens. Hard tokens are objects a user carries such as a key fob. Soft tokens are software installed on a system. A magnetometer measures magnetic fields and can be used in a mobile device to determine your location with respect to Earth's magnetic north and south.
92. Which of the following is an open source authentication encryption protocol that is widely used and that uses a third party to verify user credentials?

    1. AES
    2. TACACS+
    3. Kerberos
    4. RADIUS

    Answer:

    C. Kerberos was developed and named by computer scientists at MIT. It is an open source authentication protocol that uses a third party to verify user credentials and symmetric key cryptography to encode transmissions between parties. TACACS+ is an authentication protocol developed by Cisco that is now an open standard. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is an authentication protocol that was originally used for dial-in access. It has morphed into a protocol used for authenticating remote Wi-Fi or on premises users. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is for wireless encryption and not authentication, has been around since 2001 and is the successor to TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
93. Your company allows employees to use their own devices, and as the IT director, you are naturally concerned with the security of corporate information on those devices. Which technology should you require in this situation?

    1. EFS
    2. MDM
    3. SSO
    4. UAC

    Answer:

    B. MDM (mobile device management) is a software technology that allows an IT department to retain control over corporate data while allowing users to use their personal devices. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) can save companies money on hardware but presents a security risk. Using MDM, an IT administrator can restrict the type of data and applications that are used with company information. They can also wipe all corporate information off a device that is lost or stolen, or if an employee leaves the company. EFS (Encrypting File System) is used to encrypt files and folders in Windows OSs, excluding Home editions. The purpose of single sign-on (SSO) is to give users access to all the applications and systems that they need when they log on. Some of the systems may require users to enter their credentials again, but the username and password will be consistent between systems. UAC (User Account Control) verifies that someone has the authority to change a system before making any changes by requiring them to enter an administrator password for certain operations.
94. Which of the following is not a logical security method of delivering a code for multifactor authentication?

    1. Voice call
    2. Email
    3. Bollards
    4. SMS

    Answer:

    C. Bollards are a method of physical security that can be used to keep vehicles out of a particular area. Voice calls, email, and SMS (short message service) can all be used to deliver a one-time code for multifactor authentication.
95. Which of the following is an example of a hard token? (Choose two.)

    1. Key fob
    2. Retina scanner
    3. Smartcard
    4. Motion sensor

    Answer:

    A, C. Both smartcards and key fobs are hard tokens. Hard tokens are a physical security device that can be carried about by the user. A smartcard has a chip whose data can be accessed by a reader to allow a user access to a secure area or computer system. A key fob generates a random number every few seconds that can be entered into a system as part of multifactor authentication. Retina scanners are biometric devices, because they use part of your body as authentication/identification, and while motion sensors are a part of physical security, they're generally used in conjunction with alarm systems.
96. Which of the following devices. often found in smartphones and other mobile devices, is used to pinpoint a person's location on Earth, and therefore can be used for multifactor authentication?

    1. Magnetometer
    2. Retina scanner
    3. Key fob
    4. Hard token

    Answer:

    A. A magnetometer measures magnetic fields and can be used to locate a person's position on Earth. As a part of multifactor authentication, that location is compared to an allow or block list, and if the device to be accessed is in an allowed location, access may be granted. A retina scanner is a biometric device that scans a person's eye to determine if access should be granted. A key fob will generate a code that changes every few seconds. A key fob is a type of hard token used for authentication.
97. Which of the following is not a physical security measure for protecting computer systems and access to them?

    1. Lighting
    2. Equipment locks
    3. Motion sensors
    4. Soft token

    Answer:

    D. A soft token is a logical, rather than a physical, security measure. An example of a soft token would be an authenticator app on your cell phone used to generate a code to access a website. Proper lighting can often deter would-be attackers, as can equipment and door locks, and motion sensors that trigger alarms.
98. Which of the following is not a biometric identification device?

    1. Fingerprint reader
    2. Retina scanner
    3. Hard token
    4. Palmprint scanner

    Answer:

    C. A hard token is a security device that a computer user has in their possession, such as a key fob or smartcard. Biometric devices are those that use a part of your body to identify you and either deny or allow access to a system based on your identity.
99. A user is worried about others shoulder surfing. What should they use to help avoid this problem?

    1. Access control vestibule
    2. Video surveillance
    3. Display privacy filter
    4. Smartcard

    Answer:

    C. To prevent shoulder surfing, a user could install a display privacy filter. Privacy filters are either film or glass add-ons that are placed over a monitor or laptop screen to prevent the data on the screen from being readable when viewed from the sides. Only the user sitting directly in front of the screen can read the data. In shoulder surfing, a potential attacker is literally looking over someone's shoulder to try to read what is on their screen. An access control vestibule is an area between two doors that helps to prevent tailgating. Video surveillance occurs when there are security cameras watching a secure area and a person observing the output of those cameras. Smartcards are devices that a user can carry that will authenticate them to a system as a part of multifactor login.
100.    Which type of malware will often cause critical files to disappear, often while displaying a taunting message, and requires user intervention (usually inadvertent) to spread from computer to computer?

        1. Botnet
        2. Virus
        3. Trojan
        4. Rootkit

        Answer:

        B. Many viruses will announce that you're infected as soon as they gain access to your system. They may take control of your system and flash annoying messages on your screen or destroy your hard disk. When this occurs, you'll know that you're a victim. Other viruses will cause your system to slow down, cause files to disappear from your computer, or take over your disk space. Many viruses today are spread using email. The infected system attaches a file to any email that you send to another user. The recipient opens this file, thinking it's something that you legitimately sent them. When they open the file, the virus infects the target system. A botnet is a group of computers that are used to perpetrate an attack without the knowledge of the authorized user of that computer. The computer is called a zombie and is controlled by some third-party attacker. A Trojan is malicious software that hides in that fun game or screen saver that you just downloaded, and it installs when you install the innocent-looking files. A rootkit is malware that gains access to a system as administrator, giving it full control over a system. Rootkits are adept at hiding their presence and so are difficult to eradicate.
101.    A computer user in the accounting department received a phone call from someone who claimed to be from the company's bank. They had a partial account number and needed the user to verify the full account number, their username, and password before they could discuss the reason for their call with the user. The user said they would call them back, and the caller on the other end hung up abruptly. They contacted you in the IT department because it seemed like such a strange call. What kind of attempted attack will you tell them just happened?

        1. Phishing
        2. Vishing
        3. Whaling
        4. Evil twin

        Answer:

        B. Vishing, phishing, and whaling are variations of the same type of attack. In all of these, someone attempts to gain usernames and passwords or other information by intimidation, coercion, or other means. Then they'll use that information to attack your company's systems. They're all play-on-words for fishing. The attacker is casting a line and hoping you will bite on it. Vishing is using voice calls, phishing uses email, and whaling is phishing for powerful or wealthy fish (people). An evil twin attack happens when someone plugs an unauthorized WAP (wireless access point) into your network and gives it the same SSID (service set identifier) that your valid network has.
102.    Your company allows employees to use their personal devices for company work, because it will save the company money on hardware. What is this called?

        1. BYOD
        2. MDM
        3. SSO
        4. UAC

        Answer:

        A. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) can save companies money on hardware and make users happy, but BYOD presents a security risk. Mobile device management (MDM) is a software technology that allows an IT department to retain control over corporate data while allowing users to use their personal devices. Using MDM, an IT administrator can restrict the type of data and applications that are used with company information. They can also wipe all corporate information off a device that is lost or stolen, or if an employee leaves the company. The purpose of single sign-on (SSO) is to give users access to all the applications and systems that they need when they log on. Some of the systems may require users to enter their credentials again, but the username and password will be consistent between systems. User Account Control (UAC) verifies that someone has the authority to change a system before making any changes by requiring them to enter an administrator password for certain operations.
103.    Why is an EOL OS a security threat?

        1. There will be no more security updates.
        2. There will be no more feature updates.
        3. There will be no more company support.
        4. The software will stop working on the EOL date.

        Answer:

        A. When an operating system is at end of life (EOL), it means that the company will no longer be supporting the software. That might not be a problem if you're an expert with the software and it meets your needs. The security problem arises because an EOL software will no longer receive security updates, making your network vulnerable to attack. The operating system won't magically stop working on the EOL date, and while you won't get any new features, that isn't a threat to security.
104.    What type of malware is dangerous because it is loaded during system startup before the antivirus software is able to load?

        1. Spyware
        2. Ransomware
        3. Boot sector virus
        4. Keylogger

        Answer:

        C. When a virus infects the boot sector, Master Boot Record (MBR), or partition table of a hard drive, it is called a boot sector virus. Boot sector viruses load before the operating system and security software can load. They may delete or modify files needed to boot the system, or the system may show no signs of being infected until an antivirus program is run. Removing the boot sector virus from a system may require booting to a different OS or drive. Spyware is designed to watch what you do and where you go, hoping to gain information such as logins, passwords, and bank account numbers. Ransomware locks a system in some way or encrypts data and won't allow access until the system's owner pays a ransom. A keylogger is malware that records every keystroke and reports it back to a third party. This information might include user IDs and passwords, or even bank account numbers and login information.
105.    Which of the following is not a type of malware that needs to be eradicated from a computer system?

        1. Keylogger
        2. Virus
        3. WinRE
        4. Spyware

        Answer:

        C. Keyloggers, viruses, and spyware are all types of malware, although anti-malware and antivirus are often used interchangeably. Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) is a tool used to repair problems with the operating system (OS). In addition to other tools such as startup repair and refreshing the OS, it provides access to a command prompt utility that can be used to correct problems without booting into the Windows operating system.
106.    You believe your computer has contracted a boot sector virus. Which command-line tool permits someone to make changes to the operating system without having to boot up Windows?

        1. WinRE
        2. RADIUS
        3. Administrative tools
        4. Active Directory

        Answer:

        A. The Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) in Windows 10/11 provides a command-line tool (among other tools) that allows the administrator the ability to copy or remove directories, enable or disable services, write a new Master Boot Record (MBR), format volumes, and much more. If you have a virus that has infected the boot sector of the hard drive, the only way to access the system before the boot sector virus loads is to boot to another drive, either a DVD or a USB that contains either the Windows installation media or an antivirus. Using the installation media is one way to enter the WinRE. Typically the system will automatically enter the WinRE if booting into Windows has failed three times in a row. You can force this to happen by turning the power off as soon as Windows starts to load, and repeating that until the system boots into WinRE. From the recovery environment main screen, choose Troubleshoot ➢ Advanced Options ➢ Command Prompt to get to the command prompt. Here you can enter commands or run antivirus software to remove a boot sector virus on the other hard drive. RADIUS is an authentication encryption protocol. Administrative Tools can be found in Control Panel of Windows 10 and is a collection of commonly used tools. Administrative Tools is not available in Windows 11. Active Directory is the database and software used to control and manage a Windows domain.
107.    You're reviewing the Event Viewer logs and notice repeated failed attempts to access the corporate bank account information. The attempts are coming from someone with a company login, and in fact, you are able to catch the person, an employee hired only a month ago, in the act. What type of attack is this?

        1. Insider threat
        2. Eval twin
        3. Whaling
        4. Social engineering

        Answer:

        A. When someone who is an authorized user on your system attempts to gain access to something they should not or attempts a malicious act on your computer system, an insider threat has occurred. An evil twin is when an unauthorized wireless access point (WAP) appears on your network, using your service set identifier (SSID) and users are able to connect to the network using the unauthorized access point. Whaling is going after a big target using vishing or phishing. Social engineering is an attempt to acquire information about your network and system by social means, such as talking to people in the organization, shoulder surfing, tailgating, or other methods.
108.    Your web server just crashed because there was a flood of responses to a packet that looks like it was from your server but your server didn't send it. What just happened?

        1. Whaling attack
        2. Denial-of-service attack
        3. Distributed DoS attack
        4. Evil twin attack

        Answer:

        B. This is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Someone spoofs your IP address (making it look like you) and sends out requests all at once to multiple hosts who respond to your IP address. Your server is flooded with those responses and crashes. It's called a DoS attack because users who want to use the server for legitimate purposes such as placing an order are unable to due to all the malicious traffic. Whaling is using phishing to go after a big target. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks happen when many computers are used, as in a botnet. An evil twin attack happens when someone plugs an unauthorized wireless access point (WAP) into your network and gives it the same service set identifier (SSID) that your valid network has.
109.    A computer user on your network is trying to access a folder named `Projects` on a local NTFS volume. Their user account is in the Developers group. The Developers group has Read & Execute permissions to the folder, and the user's user account has Full Control. What is the user's effective access to the `Projects` folder?

        1. Full Control
        2. Read & Execute
        3. Read
        4. No access

        Answer:

        A. In this case, the user has Full Control. When there are conflicting NTFS permissions, generally they are combined and the most liberal is granted. This holds true for conflicting permissions between groups or between a user's account and group memberships. The exception is Deny, which overrides all other permissions.
110.    You've discovered that a system on your network has had its firewall turned off and antivirus disabled. What type of vulnerability does this present?

        1. Zero-day attack
        2. SQL injection
        3. Unprotected system
        4. Cross-site scripting

        Answer:

        C. This system is vulnerable to attack because it is unprotected. The remedy is to turn on the system's software firewall and antivirus protection. Zero-day attacks happen the same day a vulnerability is discovered and attackers are able to evade antivirus programs because the antivirus companies have not had the time to respond to the vulnerability yet. A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection occurs when an attacker puts code into a database instead of data and the code is executed, giving the attacker access to the data in the database. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is similar to a SQL injection, except it uses a website and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or JavaScript instead of a database. Code is injected into the website and used to gather data from legitimate-website users because their systems don't see the normally trusted website as a threat.
111.    What Active Directory security measure moves a user's data to a server and off the local drive so that if a laptop is lost or stolen and someone gains access to it, they won't have access to information in the user's data files?

        1. Home folder
        2. Security group
        3. Organizational unit
        4. Login script

        Answer:

        A. Using a home folder on an Active Directory server to store the user's files adds a level of security because the user's data is not on the local drive and is less subject to being stolen. A security group is used to grant permissions to a shared resource. Organizational units are groupings that can include people, computers, and resources. Group Policies can be applied to organizational units, ensuring that all computers and users in that group are given the proper access to resources. A login script is used to automate activities when a user or computer logs into a domain.
112.    You notice that your computer seems to be working more than the normal updating that it does when you're not actively using it. It also seems to be running more slowly than normal. What type of malware, instead of stealing your data, uses your computing power?

        1. Spyware
        2. Ransomware
        3. Keyloggers
        4. Cryptominers

        Answer:

        D. Cryptominers are malware that want to use your computing power rather than steal your data. You may notice that the computer is performing more slowly than usual. Spyware is designed to watch what you do and where you go, hoping to gain information such as logins, passwords, and bank account numbers. Ransomware locks a system in some way or encrypts data and won't allow access until the system's owner pays a ransom. A keylogger is malware that records every keystroke and reports it back to a third party.
113.    Which of the following is not important in preventing malware from damaging your computer system?

        1. User education regarding common threats
        2. Installing a keylogger
        3. Keeping anti-malware signatures up-to-date
        4. Keeping operating systems and applications patches up-to-date

        Answer:

        B. Installing a keylogger would be installing malware, and exactly the opposite of what you need to do to keep a system safe. Educating users about the types of malware, including recognizing them, avoiding them, and what to do with suspicious emails, phone calls, and so on, is one of the best things you can do to protect a system. Keeping antivirus/anti-malware software up-to-date so that new malware can be detected and keeping operating systems and applications up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities are key to keeping malware out.
114.    A user on your network wants to install an interesting browser extension that they found on a download site neither you nor they have used before. They got a warning before going to the site but clicked an option to continue. What type of website is this?

        1. Spoofed
        2. Trusted source
        3. Untrusted source
        4. Certified

        Answer:

        C. This is an untrusted source. Not only have you never used it before, but there is a problem with the website's certificate that caused the warning message the user received. There is no evidence that is it a spoofed site, and clearly it does not have a valid digital certificate. Digital certificates are issued by certificate authorities who confirm that a website, person, or company is who they say they are.
115.    As the IT person in a small firm using Windows operating systems, you would like a window to pop up whenever apps try to make changes to a system and when the user makes changes to the system so that an administrator password will be required to be entered. What utility will you use to configure that setting?

        1. UAC
        2. Windows Defender Firewall
        3. Facial recognition
        4. Personalization

        Answer:

        A. User Account Control (UAC) settings is where you can change when the operating system requests an administrator password before making changes to the system. The options range from Always Notify to Never Notify, with Notify Me Only If Apps Try To Make Changes To My Computer the default. UAC can be found in Windows 11 by going to Control Panel and selecting System and Security, then Security and Maintenance, and finally Change User Account Control Settings, and in Windows 10 by going to Control Panel, clicking Security and Maintenance, and clicking Change User Account Control Settings. In either version of Windows, it's easier to simply search for UAC. Windows Defender Firewall is a software firewall included in Windows operating systems. Facial recognition is a logon option, and Personalization in Settings allows you to change items such as themes, colors, and backgrounds.
116.    A friend is considering purchasing an antivirus program. You let them know that there is one included with the Windows operating system. What settings should they look for in Windows Settings?

        1. Windows Defender Firewall
        2. Virus & threat protection
        3. Windows Update
        4. Device Security

        Answer:

        B. In both Windows 10 and 11, a quick search for Virus & threat protection will bring you to the Windows Settings for that feature. Windows Defender Firewall is a built-in firewall found in Control Panel. Windows Update, which is in the Settings app, is for keeping the operating system files patched. Device Security is also found in the Settings app and has settings and information for the security features of your computer, such as the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip.
117.    Your company's website has been a victim of a botnet attack, causing your server to crash. What type of attack did the botnet attack cause?

        1. Brute-force
        2. Zero-day
        3. Distributed denial of service
        4. Non-compliant system

        Answer:

        C. A DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack is caused by a botnet attack. It is a denial of service because legitimate users are unable to access resources. The distributed part of the name comes from the fact that there was traffic from many infected computers (zombies) in different locations attacking your server at the same time, known as a botnet. Bots, by themselves, are but a form of software that runs automatically and autonomously and are not harmful. _Botnet_, however, has come to be the word used to describe malicious software running on a zombie and under the control of a bot-herder. Denial-of-service attacks—DoS and DDoS—can be launched by botnets, as can many forms of adware, spyware, and spam (via spambots). A brute-force attack uses software to repeatedly try to discover a password. Zero-day attacks happen the same day a vulnerability is discovered and are able to evade antivirus programs because the antivirus companies have not had the time to respond to the vulnerability yet. A noncompliant system is one that is not updated or complying with corporate security policies.
118.    What type of attack is like a SQL injection, except that it uses a website and HTML or JavaScript instead of a database, where malicious code is injected into the website (which is normally trusted by the user), and then used to gather data from the website user's computer because their systems don't see the normally trusted website as a threat?

        1. Zero-day attack
        2. SQL injection
        3. Unprotected system
        4. Cross-site scripting

        Answer:

        D. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is similar to a SQL injection, except that it uses a website and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or JavaScript instead of a database. Code is injected into the website and used to gather data from legitimate-website users because their systems don't see the normally trusted website as a threat. Zero-day attacks happen the same day a vulnerability is discovered and are able to evade antivirus programs because the antivirus companies have not had the time to respond to the vulnerability yet. A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection occurs when an attacker puts code into a database instead of data and the code is executed, giving the attacker access to the data in the database. An unprotected system is one that lacks normal measures of security such as a software firewall on the system and antivirus/anti-malware.
119.    Your company has different locations, each with its own management needs, but it wants a cohesive way to manage all the users, computers, and other resources on the network. What will you group those users, computers, and resources into that will provide a centralized point of control for each location?

        1. Active Directory
        2. Domain
        3. Security groups
        4. Home folders

        Answer:

        B. A domain is a grouping of resources, including people, computers, servers, printers, and so on, into a single centrally controlled unit. A domain is managed by Active Directory software. A best practice is to group the users into security groups and establish access to resources on the group level, which will then give that access to members of the group. Home folders provide a central place for users' documents, each with their own home folder, which gets the documents off the local computer, consolidating security for those folders into one place.
120.    The company's vice president just called you in the IT department because they received an email from you requesting their username and password. The VP didn't respond because they thought you should know them already. What kind of attack was just attempted?

        1. Phishing
        2. Vishing
        3. Whaling
        4. Evil twin

        Answer:

        C. Whaling is an attack on a powerful or wealthy fish (person). Phishing uses email, and vishing is using voice calls to gain information. Vishing, phishing, and whaling are variations of the same type of attack. In all of these, someone attempts to gain usernames and passwords or other information by intimidation, coercion, or other means. Then they'll use that information to attack your company's systems. They're all play-on-words for fishing. The attacker is casting a line and hoping you will bite. An evil twin attack happens when someone plugs an unauthorized wireless access point (WAP) into your network and gives it the same service set identifier (SSID) that your valid network has.
121.    What is the software used to control access to resources in a Windows domain?

        1. Home folder
        2. Security group
        3. Organizational unit
        4. Active Directory

        Answer:

        D. Active Directory is the name given to the software and large database that is used to manage resources on a Windows domain. Using a home folder on an Active Directory server to store the user's files adds a level of security because the user's data is not on the local drive and is less subject to being stolen. A security group is a grouping of computers or users that need the same access to resources. Permissions are granted to the security group and passed on to the members of the group. Organizational units are groupings that can include people, computers, and resources. Group Policies can be applied to organizational units, ensuring that all computers and users in that group are given the proper access to resources.
122.    You've been reading about a recent malware that is causing problems for other companies and want to verify that the Windows built-in antivirus definitions are up-to-date. Where is this done?

        1. Virus & Threat Protection in the Settings app
        2. Virus & Threat Protection in Control Panel
        3. Windows Defender Firewall in the Settings app
        4. Windows Defender Firewall in Control Panel

        Answer:

        A. Virus & Threat Protection can be found in the Settings app. There you can see when the last update was done and run a system scan, among other options.
123.    You are a junior IT administrator, and your supervisor has asked you to ensure that all workstations have the built-in Windows firewall activated. Where can you go to do that? (Choose two.)

        1. Firewall & Network Protection in the Settings app
        2. Firewall & Network Protection in Control Panel
        3. Windows Defender Firewall in the Settings app
        4. Windows Defender Firewall in Control Panel

        Answer:

        A, D. The Windows built-in firewall can be configured either in the Setting app using Firewall & Network Protection or in Windows Defender Firewall, which is found in Control Panel.
124.    Your company has started using a new software in the cloud, but your users are finding that they can't use the software. Their computers are running Windows 11. What can you do to ensure that the software can be used remotely by the employees? (Choose two.)

        1. Click Allow An App Through Firewall in the Firewall & Network Protection settings of the Settings app.
        2. Click Allow An App Through Firewall in the Virus & Threat Protection settings of the Settings app.
        3. Add a new rule in the Advanced settings of Windows Defender Firewall, which can be found in Control Panel.
        4. Add a new rule in Administrative Tools in Control Panel.

        Answer:

        A, C. The firewall can be configured to allow an application through (or block one) in both the Firewall & Network Protection settings of the Settings app or in Windows Defender Firewall's Advanced settings in Control Panel. The Virus & Threat Protection settings are for configuring antivirus. Administrative Tools is found in Windows 10, not Windows 11, and it doesn't have settings for the firewall, although it does contain a shortcut to the Windows Defender Firewall.
125.    Employees in your company work on very confidential projects. All employees have been instructed to lock their screens whenever they walk away from their computer, even if it is only for a minute. What key sequence will immediately lock their desktop and require a password to reenter?

        1. Windows Key+X
        2. Windows Key+L
        3. Windows Key+Right Arrow
        4. Windows Key+D

        Answer:

        B. Use Windows Key+L simultaneously to lock the Windows desktop. Windows Key+X brings up the Power menu, which has shortcuts to many often-used tools. Windows Key+Right Arrow will snap the active window to the right half of the screen, and Windows Key+D displays the desktop by minimizing all the other apps. These keyboard shortcuts work in both Windows 10 and Windows 11.
126.    Your employees have all been trained on end-user best practices, including locking their laptop when they walk away from it. What can be done to ensure that each employee's laptop and its data will remain with the company and not fall into someone else's hands? (Choose two.)

        1. Use a cable lock to secure the laptop to the desk.
        2. Use MDM software to wipe the laptop remotely if stolen.
        3. Place the laptop in a desk drawer when the employee walks away.
        4. Ask a stranger to watch the laptop when they use the restroom at a coffee shop.

        Answer:

        A, B. A laptop cable lock uses a special slot on the side of the laptop and a very strong cable wrapped around something solid, like a desk leg, to secure the laptop to the work area. A key is used to free the laptop from the cable when you want to take it somewhere. Mobile device management (MDM) software can be used to wipe a laptop remotely if it is stolen. Placing a laptop in a desk drawer might get it out of sight, but it is still vulnerable, and you should never let a laptop out of your sight when you're in a public place.
127.    You're setting up authentication for new users of Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines. Which of the following Windows logon methods requires specific hardware? (Choose two.)

        1. Username and password
        2. PIN
        3. Fingerprint
        4. Facial recognition

        Answer:

        C, D. Fingerprints and facial recognition are both biometric logins and require a fingerprint reader and camera, respectively. Many laptops come equipped with this hardware, but not all. Both could be added to a laptop or desktop that is missing the hardware by connecting them via a USB port. Username and password can also be used, and a personal identification number (PIN) is used. Windows gives you the option to include letters and symbols in your PIN, or just numbers.
128.    You're setting up new users on your network and have let them know that they will need to change their user password the first time they log in and that it must meet complexity requirements. Which of the following is not true about password best practices?

        1. Password minimum length is eight characters.
        2. Longer passwords are better.
        3. At least one of each of these should be used: upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        4. Passwords that are four characters long are okay if they are complex.

        Answer:

        D. Passwords should be a bare minimum of eight characters long, and complexity should be required using at least one upper- and one lowercase letter, number, and special character. If you must choose between a longer password or a more complex password, then longer is better.
129.    You've just hired a new employee who will be working at a Windows workstation on your network. You're helping the user understand what their password should be like. Which of the following are best practices for passwords? (Choose two.)

        1. Enforce password complexity.
        2. Passwords should be easy to guess in case you forget, like your dog's name.
        3. Passwords expire after 45 days.
        4. Passwords expire after 180 days.

        Answer:

        A, C. Password complexity should be enforced. Passwords that are created by the user are better than randomly generated passwords because the user can remember them easily without having to write them down, but they should not be something that is easy for someone else to guess, like the dog's name or someone's birthday. Passwords should expire after a reasonable time, making it more difficult for someone to use a compromised password. One hundred and eighty days (6 months!) is too long of a time between password expiration; 45–90 days would be more reasonable.
130.    Your company has a Windows domain managed by a domain controller. Following best practices, what feature of the domain controller is used to apply permissions to users?

        1. Active Directory
        2. User accounts
        3. Security groups
        4. Home folders

        Answer:

        C. A domain is a grouping of resources including people, computers, servers, printers, and so on, into a single centrally controlled unit. A domain is managed by Active Directory software. A best practice is to group the users into security groups and assign permissions to the security groups. Members of the security group will have the access that was assigned to the group. Home folders provide a central place for the users' documents, each with their own home folder on the server. This removes the documents from the local computer, consolidating security for those folders into one place.
131.    You're configuring password requirements such as length and expiration for several Windows 11 Pro workstations. What utility can you use on the workstation to configure the password requirements?

        1. Users Accounts in Control Panel
        2. Local Users and Groups
        3. Administrative Tools
        4. Local Security Policy

        Answer:

        D. Password policies such as history, password age, length, and complexity can be found in Local Security Policy ➢ Password Policy. User Accounts in Control Panel is for adding and managing users. You can set the password there, but not the password policies. Administrative Tools is available in Windows 10, but not Windows 11. Local Security Policy is in Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11 only, not Home editions.
132.    A user of a computer that you administer on your Active Directory domain has forgotten their logon password. What can be done to get them back into the system?

        1. Reset the password on the local computer.
        2. Reset the password on the domain controller.
        3. Reinstall the OS and re-create their user.
        4. Make them a new account with a new username.

        Answer:

        B. One of the features of the domain controller and Active Directory is that there is a central place to control and manage security, including users' passwords. You can easily reset their password and allow them to create a new one at next login. Resetting it on the local computer would not work because they log into the domain. Reinstalling the OS and making a new username are simply not necessary.
133.    A computer user is setting up a new Windows 11 Home computer for the first time. They called you because they can't figure out how to set it up with a local account. What will you tell them?

        1. That option is not available. They must use a Microsoft account.
        2. Press F10 during bootup to create a local account.
        3. They must switch to the Pro edition if they want to use a local account after setup.
        4. Local accounts are never available in Windows 11.

        Answer:

        A. When setting up a Windows 11 Home PC for the first time, you are required to use a Microsoft account. The setup will allow you to create one during setup. Pressing F10 does not change the type of account you need to set up Windows 11 Home. A local account can be used whether they have Windows 11 Home or Pro, but when setting up the Home version, it must be set up with a Microsoft account. It is possible to add a local account later and use it to log in to either Windows 11 Home or Pro.
134.    When using a Microsoft account to log in to your Windows 11 computer, which of the following is not true?

        1. Your username is your email.
        2. There are more recovery options if you use a Microsoft account rather than a local account to access your computer.
        3. You won't be able to use your computer if your Internet access is down.
        4. You can access information stored on OneDrive from another computer if you log in with your Microsoft account.

        Answer:

        C. You will be able to use your computer if you log in using your Microsoft account, even if the Internet is down. It will just use cached versions of files. All the other options are true.
135.    Your friend wants to change the password for another user who is unable to log into the PC because they forgot their password. When they try to access User Accounts in Control Panel, they are unable to access it. What will you tell them?

        1. They need administrator access to change or create another user's account, and they are only a standard user.
        2. They can change it in Local Users and Groups.
        3. They need to use the command-line utility to change the user's password.
        4. They can't change the password but they can add a new username for the password and make that user an administrator so that they can access their data.

        Answer:

        A. Administrators have access to everything in the system, but a standard user account is limited in what they can do. They are not able to add or manage another user's account, for example. Nor are they able to access another user's files. Local Users and Groups is available in Pro or greater editions, but a standard user still won't be able to manage users there.
136.    You are disposing of used hard drives, and a network administrator recommends performing a low-level format. What is the difference between a low-level format and a standard format?

        1. Low-level formats are performed at the factory, and standard formats are performed using the `format` command.
        2. Standard formats are performed at the factory, and low-level formats are performed using the `format` command.
        3. A modern low-level format fills the entire drive with zeros, returning it to factory mode. A standard format creates the file allocation table and root directory.
        4. A standard format records the tracks and marks the start of each sector on each track. A low-level format creates the file allocation table and root directory.

        Answer:

        C. What is known as a low-level format now (also called a zero-fill) is drastically different than it was years ago. The intent is the same, though, and that is to erase all data on the hard drive so it's not recoverable. Technically, the low-level format needs to happen first. Then the drive is partitioned, creating one or more sections, and a standard format is used to create the file allocation table and root directory.
137.    You have been instructed to destroy several old hard drives that contained confidential information, so you take them to a local company that specializes in this process. The IT director wants confirmation that the drives were properly destroyed. What do you need to provide him with?

        1. Hard drive fragments
        2. Photos of the destroyed hard drives
        3. A notarized letter from the disposal company
        4. A certificate of destruction

        Answer:

        D. A certificate of destruction (or certificate of recycling) may be required for audit purposes. Such a certificate, usually issued by the organization carrying out the destruction, is intended to verify that the asset was properly destroyed and usually includes serial numbers, type of destruction done, and so on.
138.    You work for a bank whose policy is to physically destroy, rather than recycle, hard drives that are no longer needed. Which of the following is not a physical destruction method for hard drives?

        1. Incinerating
        2. Drilling
        3. Zero-filling
        4. Shredding

        Answer:

        C. Zero-filling a drive will make data that was once on the drive unreadable, but it is not a physical destruction method. Methods of physical destruction include drilling, shredding, degaussing, and incinerating.
139.    A friend is getting overwhelmed with the number of passwords they need to remember and has been writing them down, but the passwords aren't very complex, and your friend has used the same ones on several sites. You offer to help them. What will you do?

        1. Clear their browser cache.
        2. Clear their browsing data.
        3. Update their certificates.
        4. Install a password manager.

        Answer:

        D. A password manager is software that uses algorithms to generate secure passwords. The passwords are encrypted in the software manager. The user only needs to remember a single password to access the password manager, not all the other passwords. Most password managers will use two-factor authentication to allow the user to log in and change any passwords. Websites that you access are stored in a cache on your computer so that the next time you visit the website, it will only download the changes and make websites load much more quickly. If a website you visit isn't updating properly, clearing the cache should resolve the issue. Certificates are issued by a certificate authority and prove that the website (or person) is who they say they are. A browser may warn you or block your access to a website whose certificate is expired or invalid.
140.    You work for a company that is trying to be green. They want to repurpose their old PCs by giving them to a charitable organization rather than destroying or recycling them. What should you do before you give them away? (Choose two.)

        1. Wipe all drives.
        2. Restore the computer to its factory default condition.
        3. Create a new user for the charity and delete your user.
        4. Delete users and all their files and leave a generic administrator account active.

        Answer:

        A, B. Before you give a computer to someone else, you will certainly want to remove all of your data from it. The best way to do this is to zero-write (also called a low-level format) the drive, then restore it to its factory default condition. This can often be accomplished with a utility provided by the computer manufacturer, or in Windows, by using options in WinRE.
141.    You're donating a Windows 10 PC to a charity, but first want to remove all your data and restore the PCs OS to a factory install. You've booted into WinRE. What does Microsoft call the recovery option to reinstall the OS and delete all user files and data?

        1. Refresh Your PC
        2. Reset Your PC
        3. Restore Your PC
        4. Repair Your PC

        Answer:

        B. Choosing Reset Your PC will give you two options. You can choose to keep your personal files but remove apps and settings, or remove everything, including your files, and perform a fresh installation.
142.    You are setting up a Windows 11 Pro computer that will house data shared by many people. How will you establish security for this group?

        1. Use the Local Users and Groups app to create groups such as Accounting, Office, and so on. Then set up permissions for each group on shared files. Add and remove users to the group as needed.
        2. In Control Panel, User Accounts, make all users administrators so they can do what they need.
        3. Use the Local Users and Groups app to create groups such as Accounting, Office, and so on. Then set up permissions for each person on the shared files. Add users to the groups just for organizational purposes.
        4. Groups are only used on servers, so set up each person with their specific NTFS permissions on the shared data folders.

        Answer:

        A. Option A, use the Local Users and Groups app to create groups, set up permissions for each group on shared files, then add users to the group as needed, is considered a best practice. By arranging security in this way, when someone changes jobs, leaves the company, or joins the company, all you need to do is remove the user from the group and/or add them to the group with the security access that they need. This process saves on human error as there is just one place that security is set up (for the group) instead of establishing the settings for each individual user. Local Users and Groups is available in Pro or better versions of modern Windows operating systems.
143.    You're providing system training to a new employee, and they want to know where they should keep their password. What will you tell them? (Choose two.)

        1. Write the password on a sticky note attached to the bottom of their keyboard.
        2. Passwords will be saved in password manager software, and multifactor authentication is used for network access.
        3. Tape the password to the monitor so they can see it.
        4. They need to memorize their password and not write it down.

        Answer:

        B, D. One of the best things you can do to protect a network is to train employees on how to handle IT information and events. All too often users put their passwords where they are easy for them to find, but they are also too easy for someone with malicious intent to find. Passwords need to meet complexity requirements but be simple enough for a user to understand. Other tools for securing passwords are to use password management software and multifactor authentication. Windows Credential Manager and macOS Keychain are two utilities that can manage passwords for users. Credential Manager is not on the CompTIA A+ objectives, but Keychain is.
144.    Which of the following are best practices for managing user accounts? (Choose two.)

        1. Restrict user permissions.
        2. Restrict login times.
        3. Enable the Guest account.
        4. Give all users administrative access.

        Answer:

        A, B. Following the principle of least privilege, users should be given only the access that they need and nothing more. If a user needs to read files but not change them, then they should be restricted to reading those files only. Sometimes even the most careful users can make changes that they did not intend. If a user works only Monday to Friday, then they should not be able to log in on the weekend. Having their login available gives a hacker one more way to get into your system. The Guest account is disabled by default and should remain disabled. Even administrators should have a standard user account that they will use unless they are doing something that requires administrative access. Then they would only log on as an administrator while doing that activity.
145.    Workers have been instructed to lock their computers whenever they walk away from them, but as you walk around the company, you notice computers unlocked and no one sitting there. What is the best solution to mitigate this problem? (Choose two.)

        1. Fire people who won't lock their computer.
        2. Enforce screen saver locks after a short time of inactivity.
        3. Train users on the importance of locking their PC.
        4. Set the PC to shut down after 2 minutes of inactivity.

        Answer:

        B, C. Configuring all the computers to lock the screen saver after a short period of inactivity would help to mitigate the problem. If a user was still at their desk but doing something else, they could easily enter their password and log in again. Training employees on network and data safety is always helpful. Firing them would be a very drastic measure, but depending on the environment, it might be the company policy. Setting the PC to shut down after 2 minutes of inactivity is also a bit drastic, and you wouldn't want to risk losing whatever the employee was working on. Locking the screen saver can be just as effective.
146.    Data encryption has been established for data that travels across the network, but you work in a secure environment and want to encrypt all the data on users' storage drives, including laptop drives, to prevent dissemination of information if the drives are compromised or stolen. Which of the following would not be a good solution to encrypt this data-at-rest?

        1. Use EFS and let the employee choose what to encrypt.
        2. Use a third-party encryption solution.
        3. Use MDM software.
        4. Use BitLocker on desktop systems.

        Answer:

        A. Data-at-rest is any data that is sitting on a drive somewhere. It's not moving between network locations, but it needs to be protected. Letting the employee choose what to encrypt with EFS is not a good solution because it opens too much possibility for human error. There are third-party companies that specialize in protecting data-at-rest. Other solutions are to use MDM (mobile device management) software. Using MDM, the IT administrator can enforce encryption on remote devices, even those owned by employees who are using their personal devices for company business. If the device is lost or stolen, company data can be wiped from it using MDM software. BitLocker is a solution for encrypting entire hard drives, but it requires Pro or higher editions of both Windows 10 and 11 and a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip or module on the motherboard. BitLocker stores an encryption key in the TPM, and the TPM will only allow access to the key when the computer started as expected.
147.    You have a new smartphone that can authorize a transaction by using your phone's camera while you are simply looking at it. What is this technology called?

        1. Pin code
        2. Fingerprint scanner
        3. Device encryption
        4. Facial recognition

        Answer:

        D. Facial recognition and fingerprint readers are available on an increasing number of smartphones and mobile devices. Facial recognition uses your cell phone's camera, sensors, and a dot projector to make a 3D map of your face. The phone then uses that 3D map to recognize you for future transactions. Pin codes are a number that you enter to gain access. Fingerprint scanners require that you touch a spot repeatedly to set up. Once the device has a map of your fingerprint, you can use your finger to log in or authorize certain transactions. Device encryption is not a method of identifying the user.
148.    Which method of logging into a mobile device may make it easy for someone to guess your password based on marks left by the oils in your skin?

        1. Facial recognition
        2. Fingerprint
        3. Pattern
        4. Swipe

        Answer:

        C. Some mobile devices allow the user to draw a pattern on the screen that is recognized by the device, then the user is allowed access. The problem with using this security device is that, because the pattern is repeatedly drawn on the screen, someone may see the oils left behind by your skin and be able to figure out the pattern that is drawn. Facial recognition uses the mobile device's camera to make and store a 3D map of your face. To gain access to the device, the camera reads your face again and compares it to the stored image. Fingerprint readers compare your fingerprint to one stored on the device for access. With a swipe lock, the user merely swipes across the screen to unlock it.
149.    Which of the following is the least secure way to access a mobile device whose screen is locked?

        1. Facial recognition
        2. PIN code
        3. Swipe
        4. Pattern

        Answer:

        C. Most mobile devices will lock after a period of inactivity. For some, merely swiping across the device will unlock it. Since this can be done by anyone, it isn't secure. Facial recognition is a biometric (something that you are) type of identification, so it is quite secure depending on the software that is used to recognize the face. PIN codes and patterns are something that the user must know, and although a hacker may figure them out, they're still more secure than merely swiping across the device.
150.    You just installed a security camera that communicates on port 4150. The video camera is connected to your SOHO router. With the camera set up, you can view the video stream from your computer that is on the same SOHO router, but not remotely on your phone or another computer. What did you forget to do?

        1. Configure port forwarding on the router.
        2. Close port 4150.
        3. Connect the camera to the router.
        4. Disable the firewall.

        Answer:

        A. Since the camera communicates over port 4150, the port would need to be open and port forwarding configured so that your remote connection can access the camera, through the router, using that port. You know that the camera is properly connected to the router because you can access the video stream on it from a computer connected to the same router. Disabling the firewall should not be done because the firewall is a vital part of your network's security.
151.    You are installing a SOHO router and a wired network for a small office. The manager is concerned that employees will visit websites with objectionable material. Which feature should you look for in a router to help prevent such access?

        1. Content filtering
        2. Disabling ports
        3. VPN access
        4. Port forwarding/mapping

        Answer:

        A. Content filtering is the process of blocking objectionable content from either websites or email. Many routers and firewalls will provide content filtering services. In many cases, a reference service is used to block websites, and filters can be implemented to scan emails for prohibited content. Disabling ports stops traffic from entering the network. It does not filter for content. VPN access means that a user can access the network remotely just as if they were sitting in the office. Port forwarding/mapping is used when you need traffic on a particular port to go to a particular network device. It is often used for gaming and security cameras.
152.    Your office is in a building with several other companies. You want to configure the wireless network so that casual users in the building are not able to easily see your network name. What should you do to configure this?

        1. Enable WPA3.
        2. Enable MAC filtering.
        3. Disable SSID broadcasts.
        4. Reduce radio power levels.

        Answer:

        C. One method of “protecting” the network that is often recommended is to turn off the SSID (service set identifier) broadcast. The SSID is the name of your network. The access point is still there and can still be accessed by those who know of it, but it prevents those who are looking at a list of available networks from finding it. This should be considered a weak form of security because there are still ways, albeit a bit more complicated, to discover the presence of the access point besides the SSID broadcast. WPA3 is a secure Wi-Fi encryption standard. MAC (Media Access Control) filtering allows or denies access to the network based on the MAC address associated with a NIC (Network Interface Card).
153.    You're changing some configuration settings on your SOHO router and notice that WPA3 is not available. What might you be able to do to resolve this issue?

        1. Configure port forwarding.
        2. Configure content filtering.
        3. Update the SSID.
        4. Update the router's firmware.

        Answer:

        D. Just like computers, routers occasionally need their software updated to add new features or correct security holes. On a router this is called a firmware update because it is updating software that is embedded in chips on the router's circuit board (i.e., the router's firmware). Port forwarding will send traffic for a specified port number to a specified computer. Content filtering inspects packets for specified content and rejects or allows packets to enter or leave the network based on those criteria. The SSID (service set identifier) is the name of the network.
154.    Which of the following are very fast and very secure ways to access your mobile device? (Choose two.)

        1. PIN code
        2. Fingerprint scanner
        3. Swipe
        4. Facial recognition

        Answer:

        B, D. Facial recognition and fingerprint readers are available on an increasing number of smartphones and mobile devices, and they can identify you faster than you can enter numbers on a screen. Facial recognition uses your cell phone's camera, sensors, and a dot projector to make a 3D map of your face. The phone then uses that 3D map to recognize you for future transactions. Fingerprint readers can use capacitive, optical, or ultrasonic sensors, but regardless of the method, they make a map of your fingerprint and, like facial recognition, compare that map to your body. With either one you can gain access to a device or authorize a transaction in about one second. PIN codes are a number that you enter to gain access. They can be entered quickly but can also be guessed, so they're not as secure as biometrics (fingerprint scanning and facial recognition). Using a swipe to unlock a mobile device is fast but not secure.
155.    You're setting up a SOHO network that uses DHCP but would like the IP address for a printer to remain consistent. What will you configure on the router to achieve this?

        1. DHCP scope
        2. DHCP reservations
        3. APIPA scope
        4. Loopback address

        Answer:

        B. Configuring a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) reservation means that you're setting aside a particular IP address to be used only with a specific device. That IP address is then not one of the addresses that the DHCP server can assign to workstations attempting to connect to it and be given an IP address. The DHCP scope is the range of IP addresses that can be assigned, such as 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199, which would yield 100 private class C IP addresses. There is no such thing as an APIPA scope. An APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) address is not configured on a router, or anywhere. It is an address in the 169.254.x.x range and is generated by an operating system when it is unable to reach a DHCP server. The loopback address, 127.0.0.1 for IPv4 or ::1 for IPv6, is a number used to test TCP/IP on the local machine.
156.    What method of securing a mobile device requires entering a series of numbers?

        1. PIN code
        2. Fingerprint scanner
        3. Pattern
        4. Facial recognition

        Answer:

        A. PIN codes are a number that you enter to gain access to a mobile device. Fingerprint scanners and facial recognition systems are biometrics, meaning that they use a part of your body to identify you. Once a 3D map of the face or finger is made, that map is compared to a new one generated when you touch the screen or look into the camera. If they match, access is granted. Drawing a pattern on the screen is sometimes used.
157.    You've been using a drawn pattern on your phone to unlock it for some time, and now it simply won't work. What might quickly resolve this issue? (Choose two.)

        1. Clean the screen.
        2. Wipe the phone and do a factory reset.
        3. Restart the phone.
        4. Use your Google credentials to gain access.

        Answer:

        A, C. Oils on your skin can be left behind on the screen and cause it to not recognize a pattern or fingerprint. Cleaning the phone may help. If that doesn't work, another quick solution is to restart the phone, then try the pattern again. The other two options will take longer. If it is an Android phone and you still can't access it, you may be able to use your Google credentials to access the phone if you are logged into Google on the phone. Performing a factory reset would be akin to giving up and starting over.
158.    You own a small company with a SOHO router and a web server that is used to sell your products. You don't want the IP address of your web server to change, so you've paid the ISP for a specific IP address that is yours and will not change. What would you configure on your router for your ISP connection?

        1. Dynamic WAN IP
        2. Static WAN IP
        3. UPnP
        4. Screened subnet

        Answer:

        B. On your router you would configure a static WAN (wide area network) IP address. That is the address that the ISP (Internet service provider) has assigned to you. Usually the ISP uses dynamic addressing, and your WAN setting would be Dynamic WAN IP, so having a static WAN IP generally involves higher fees paid to the ISP. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a protocol that lets devices find and communicate with each other on your LAN (local area network) such as your laptop and your printer. Unfortunately, UPnP could also be used by malware to spread to other devices on your network. A screened subnet uses one or more routers to create a separate area on a network where servers, such as a web server, can be accessed from either inside the LAN or from the Internet. It provides greater security and protects the LAN.
159.    What is the protocol that allows devices on your LAN, such as your laptop and printer, to find each other?

        1. WPA3
        2. WPA2
        3. PIN
        4. UPnP

        Answer:

        D. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a protocol that lets devices find and communicate with each other on your LAN (local area network), such as your laptop and your printer. Unfortunately, UPnP could also be used by malware to spread to other devices on your network. WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access version 3) and WPA2 are wireless networking encryption protocols. A PIN is a personal identification number used to authenticate to a computer system.
160.    You are configuring a new SOHO router that replaced a failed one. Your network has a mixture of devices purchased several years ago and newer ones purchased in 2022. Which of the following encryption options should you choose?

        1. WPA3
        2. WPA2
        3. WPA2/WPA3
        4. WEP

        Answer:

        C. WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access version 3) is the newest and most secure wireless encryption protocol for your SOHO router, but the devices that you've had for a few years might not be able to work with it. For the time being, until those legacy devices can be replaced, it's best to use the WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode so that all your devices can connect to the network as securely as possible. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) should no longer be used because it is not secure. Also, it is not listed in the CompTIA A+ exam objectives.
161.    You perform very confidential work as a government contractor, and you work from home. Your contract specifies that the only external computers your computers can communicate with are the government computers involved in the project. What can you configure on your router to block all other computers from communicating with your network?

        1. IP address filtering
        2. Untrusted sources
        3. Hashing
        4. Port filtering

        Answer:

        A. Configuring IP filtering enables you to set which IP addresses are allowed to communicate through your router and which are not. Untrusted sources are websites that your browser has deemed suspicious or dangerous, and it warns you of such. Hashing is the act of translating a character string into code. Port filtering is a way of allowing or denying access to a network based on the port number in the packet. Filtering router traffic by port is also an excellent security practice.
162.    Your company has decided to allow users to use their own devices for company business. This decision will save the company money on hardware. To use their personal devices, the company will require that employees sign an agreement. What would this agreement be called?

        1. BYOD policy
        2. MDM policy
        3. Cell phone policy
        4. Remote work policy

        Answer:

        A. A company may have many policies and procedures that employees must agree to as a condition of employment. Two of the most common ones are an acceptable use agreement (AUP) and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies. Acceptable use policies define what you can and can't do with company technology, and the consequences if the policy is violated. The BYOD policy describes the conditions for an employee using their own device for company business. This likely includes that the company will use mobile device management (MDM) software to secure the company information on the user's device.
163.    Your iPhone requires a passcode to unlock it. Because of recent phone thefts around your office, you want to set your phone so that all data is destroyed if incorrect passcodes are entered 10 times in a row. Which feature allows you to do this?

        1. Failed login attempts restrictions
        2. Screen locks
        3. Remote wipes
        4. Locator applications

        Answer:

        A. Failed login attempt restrictions will destroy all local data on the phone if incorrect passcodes are entered 10 times in a row. While this is recommended for users with phones that contain sensitive data and that are frequently taken into public venues or placed in compromising positions, the casual user should not turn on this feature unless they can be sure there will always be a recent backup available.
164.    You own a small company with a SOHO router and a web server that is used to sell your products. You are concerned about the security of your LAN, so your IT consultant is going to set up a two-router system like the one shown in the graphic, to protect the LAN from web server traffic. What is this arrangement called?

        1. Dynamic WAN IP
        2. Static WAN IP
        3. UPnP
        4. Screened subnet

        Answer:

        D. A screened subnet uses two or more routers with packet filtering to create a separate area on a network where servers, such as a web server, can be accessed from either inside the LAN or from the Internet. This arrangement provides greater security and protects the LAN from network traffic. A static WAN IP is one that doesn't change and needs to be configured on your router. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a protocol that lets devices, such as your laptop and your printer, find and communicate with each other on your LAN. Unfortunately, UPnP could also be used by malware to spread to other devices on your network. A WAN IP is the IP address a company gets from the Internet service provider (ISP); it can be dynamic, meaning it changes, or static, meaning it doesn't.
165.    You turned your back for a minute in the coffee shop and your mobile device is missing. Which one of the following is not a way to achieve a remote wipe on a mobile device?

        1. Exceeding failed login restrictions
        2. Using Google Find My Device or Find iPhone app
        3. Using MDM software
        4. Disabling guest access

        Answer:

        D. Exactly how to wipe your device depends on the device. If you have configured failed login restrictions on your device, then after the prescribed number of failed attempts, the device will either lock or, in the case of an iOS device, 10 failed tries will cause the device to be erased. For Android devices you can use Google Find My Device to remotely wipe it, and for iOS devices you can use the Find iPhone app using a different iOS device. MDM software can also be used to wipe Apple, Android, or Windows devices. Disabling guest access is a good security practice, but it won't wipe the device's data.
166.    You are setting up a router and network for a SOHO business. The router has wired and wireless connections. Which of the following is not a method for securing the router and network?

        1. Place the router in the kitchen area for easy access.
        2. Disable any guest accounts on the network. If guests need access, set up a separate VPN for them.
        3. Ensure that the Wi-Fi signal doesn't extend beyond the required area, and if it does, lower the power of the Wi-Fi signal.
        4. Place the router in an area that can be locked.

        Answer:

        A. A kitchen is one of the worst places for a router to be. First, there will be EMI (electromagnetic interference) from appliances like refrigerators and microwaves, which will interfere with the wireless signal and if they're too close to the router or wires, they could interfere with the wired signal, too. Second, having easy access to the router might be good for the IT person, but it's a terrible idea for security. For physical security, place the router in a room or an enclosure that can be locked and out of reach of people passing by. Any guest access or guest accounts should be disabled. If your company is one that needs to have Wi-Fi available for visitors, put it on a separate VLAN (virtual LAN) so that your network isn't exposed to those connections. For Wi-Fi routers, take a walk around with a Wi-Fi meter and ensure that the signal doesn't extend into areas where it should not be. If it extends too far, you may need to turn the power down or possibly move the router.
167.    There seems to be a great deal of interference on your wireless network. You determine that it's due to the network in the office next door. What should you do to keep your network safe and reliable? (Choose three.)

        1. Change the channel your router uses.
        2. Turn your Wi-Fi signal power to maximum power to drown out theirs.
        3. Turn your signal power down to decrease interference.
        4. Try moving the router or using a different band.

        Answer:

        A, C, D. While the interference is usually more of an annoyance than a problem, having your wireless network easily accessed by others is a security issue. If you change the channel so that your Wi-Fi and theirs are on different channels, there will be less interference. Turn your signal power down to keep your Wi-Fi signal inside your office. If the offending network is already interfering with your Wi-Fi signal, turning up the power on your router's Wi-Fi signal might make it worse because there would be more crossover between your network and theirs. You could also try moving the router to an area with less interference. Finally, try using a different band to avoid interference. If you're using the 5 GHz band, try using the 2.4 GHz band instead if devices support it. Some environments employ a process called channel hopping (changing channels frequently) to avoid packet sniffing and signal jamming on their wireless networks.
168.    A user needs to download a new video card driver for their HP laptop. They find the driver on the HP site and ask you if they can download it. The HP site is an example of what?

        1. Part of an access control list
        2. An authenticator website
        3. A trusted software source
        4. An untrusted software source

        Answer:

        C. There are trusted software sources that you know and work with all the time (such as Microsoft, HP, or other manufacturers' websites) and there are untrusted sources, and you should differentiate between them. Don't use or let your users use untrusted software sources. Generally, common sense can be your guide, but there are “safe lists” of trusted software vendors from authoritative watchdog companies such as Comodo.
169.    You are planning a wireless network for a small office. Which of the following is a good rule of thumb when considering access point placement?

        1. Place them in walls or ceilings for protection.
        2. Place them near metal objects so the signal will reflect better.
        3. Place them in the center of the network area.
        4. Place them at the edge of the network area and focus them in the proper direction.

        Answer:

        C. There isn't any one universal solution to wireless access point placement; it depends a lot on the environment. As a general rule, the greater the distance the signal must travel, the more it will attenuate, but you can lose a signal quickly in a short space as well if the building materials reflect or absorb it. You should try to avoid placing access points near metal (which includes appliances) or near the ground. They should be placed in the center of the area to be served and high enough to get around most obstacles. Note that of all current 802.11 standards, only 802.11ac and 802.11ax offer directional antennae. All other standards are omnidirectional, meaning that the signal transmits in all directions.
170.    You receive an email from an overseas bank notifying you that a relative has left you a large sum of money. You need to respond with your bank routing information so they can electronically transfer the funds directly to your account. What is this most likely an example of?

        1. Phishing
        2. Ransomware
        3. Spoofing
        4. Whaling

        Answer:

        A. Social engineering is a process in which an attacker attempts to acquire information about your network and system by social means, such as talking to people in the organization. A social engineering attack may occur over the phone, by email, or in person. When the attempt is made through email or instant messaging, it is known as phishing, and it's often made to look as if a message is coming from sites where users are likely to have accounts (banks, eBay, and PayPal are popular). Ransomware is software that holds your computer hostage in a logical way, such as encrypting your hard drive and refusing to give you the key until you pay a ransom. Spoofing is when someone or something pretends to be something else, such as an attacker's server using a familiar look and feel of a website, even a similar IP. Whaling is phishing for a wealthy or influential target.
171.    All of the following are methods to keep your mobile device safe except for one. Which one is that?

        1. Use a swipe to unlock a mobile device.
        2. Accept and install OS updates as soon as possible.
        3. Install antivirus/anti-malware.
        4. Use a remote backup application to safeguard your data in the event that you must wipe your phone.

        Answer:

        A. Using a swipe to unlock a mobile device does not protect your device or your data. At the very least, using a PIN (personal identification number) is far safer than using a swipe to unlock a mobile device. Keeping operating systems up-to-date to plug any vulnerabilities is very important. All devices should have some form of antivirus, even if it is one that is built into the operating system. Make sure that you are using a remote backup application to ensure that if your mobile device is lost or stolen and you must remotely wipe all the data, you will be able to download it to a new device.
172.    Your wireless network has been working just fine, but today you're flooded with calls that employees can't access the network. You suspect that an unhappy employee who was recently fired is perpetrating a DoS attack by causing network interference. Which of the following might temporarily solve the problem?

        1. Set your router to use a different channel.
        2. Have everyone log off their computers and back on.
        3. Reset the router.
        4. Restore the router to factory defaults.

        Answer:

        A. It doesn't take much to perpetrate a DoS (denial-of-service) attack on a wireless network. Someone nearby could use a Wi-Fi analyzer to determine what channel you're using and bombard that channel with interference, bringing your network to a halt. Changing the channel would provide a temporary fix. Use a Wi-Fi analyzer to find a less crowded channel and switch to that one. You don't want to reset your router to factory defaults. That wouldn't solve the problem and would just make more work for you.
173.    Your data center recently experienced a theft of a server from the rack. Which security mechanism would protect servers from future theft?

        1. Security token
        2. Server lock
        3. Key fob
        4. Firewall

        Answer:

        B. It's a bold move to try to steal a server. But a server lock or locks on the rack door would stall future theft attempts. A key fob is a type of hard security token. A security token is something you have that authenticates who you are. A firewall can be a software or hardware device that is used to filter traffic on a network.
174.    A user is complaining that they have so many ads popping up on their screen when they are doing Internet research that they can't get their work done. What can you configure in their browser to mitigate this problem?

        1. Private-browsing mode
        2. Pop-up blocker
        3. Password manager
        4. Certificate

        Answer:

        B. Pop-up blockers are available in virtually every browser to stop those annoying ads from taking over your screen. Look in the settings for the browser. Private-browsing mode, or incognito mode, will avoid keeping your browsing history or cookies, and keep your activities from being seen by others on the same Wi-Fi or later by another user of the device. Password managers provide a single login for you and are able to generate unique and complex passwords for all the sites that you use.
175.    You work as a contractor for a government entity that requires proof of data destruction when decommissioning old hard drives and computers. What is the best way to do this?

        1. Hire a third-party vendor to do the destruction and provide a certificate of destruction and recycling.
        2. Have the recycling center give you a receipt for the drives.
        3. Destroy them within your company and show pictures of the destroyed drives.
        4. Zero-write all the drives.

        Answer:

        A. Data destruction contractors (third-party vendors) can be certified by groups such as NAID (National Association for Information Destruction) or can show that they follow government rules (such as HIPAA, in the United States) for data destruction. They can provide proof of destruction, which would be difficult to do on your own. Once you drop a drive off at a recycling center, you have no idea where that drive or its data may end up. While you could destroy the data on your own either physically or logically, it would be better to have a third-party vendor certify to the data destruction.
176.    What type of technology used in security devices requires bringing a smartcard or ID close to but not touching a card reader to gain access to an area?

        1. Access control vestibule.
        2. Key fob.
        3. Biometrics.
        4. RFID.

        Answer:

        D. Radio frequency identification (RFID) devices use a reader to access information on a special tag that can be on a smartcard. The information can be used to allow or deny access to a secured area or device. RFID is also often used for inventory and fixed asset management. An access control vestibule is an area between two doors that is often used to prevent tailgaiting. A key fob is a type of hardware token; a hardware device that a person carries to identify the user. Biometrics are devices that use a part of a person's body to identify that person such as a face, palm, or fingerprint reader.
