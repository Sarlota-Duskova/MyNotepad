    1. F-type
    2. BNC
    3. SC
    4. FC

    Answer:

    A. F-type connectors are threaded and screw into place. F-type connectors are often found at the end of an ISP's cable connection. BNC connectors were once used in LAN wiring but are now found in RF and video applications and test equipment such as oscilloscopes. The BNC connector locks by twisting one-quarter turn. SC and FC connectors are for fiber-optic cable.
2.  Of the following fiber connectors, which are used for duplex (two strands instead of one)? (Choose two.)

    1. ST
    2. SC
    3. FC
    4. LC

    Answer:

    B, D. Both SC and LC connectors are square and can be purchased in single or duplex connectors. SC is square and is a push/pull design. ST have a bayonet connection. FC connectors have a threaded coupling. LC connectors are smaller at 1.25 mm and have a latching mechanism to keep them in place, making them good for rack mount use. SC, FC, and ST connectors are 2.5 mm. There are other connectors on the market, but not on the A+ exam.
3.  What twisted pair connectors are commonly used with telephone wire?

    1. RJ-45
    2. Coaxial
    3. RJ-11
    4. FC

    Answer:

    C. RJ-11 accommodates two pair of wires and is the standard for household or office wired telephone connections. RJ-45 is the four pair connector used for twisted-pair Ethernet. Coaxial is a type of network cable and would have a BNC connector (with a locking mechanism) or an F-type connector. FC is a type of fiber-optic connector.
4.  Using the T568B wiring standard on both ends of a cable would produce what type of network cable?

    1. T568B on both ends is not a working network cable.
    2. T568B is a telephone wiring standard.
    3. T568B on both ends is a crossover network cable.
    4. T568B on both ends is a straight-through network cable.

    Answer:

    D. A cable with the same T568 standard on both ends is a straight-through network cable. These are used for patch cables and network drops. If you have a T568A on one end and a T568B on the other, that's a crossover cable.
5.  You're looking at a connector that has eight wires with colors in the order of green stripe, green, orange stripe, blue, blue stripe, orange, brown stripe, brown. What type of cable do you have?

    1. Twisted pair, T568A standard
    2. Twisted pair, T568B standard
    3. LC
    4. SC

    Answer:

    A. The color code listed is the T568A standard. In the T568B standard the orange and green are opposite. LC and SC are fiber-optic connectors.

    1. Bonjour
    2. AirPrint
    3. TCP printing
    4. Virtual printing

    Answer:

    C. TCP printing allows clients with different OSs to send jobs directly to printers without worrying about intra-OS conflicts. Bonjour and AirPrint are both Apple services, and virtual printing allows you to print output to documents such as PDF files. Whenever sharing printers for remote printing, be sure to set proper user authentication on the print device.
17. Which one of the following connector types are you most likely to find on the end of a Cat 6a cable?

    1. RJ-11
    2. RJ-45
    3. BNC
    4. SATA

    Answer:

    B. A Cat 6a cable is a twisted pair network cable, and you are most likely to find an RJ-45 connector at the end of it. RJ-11 connectors are for phone lines. BNC connectors are network connectors but are typically used with coaxial cable. SATA connectors are used with hard drives.
18. Identify the video connector shown here.

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c03uf003_0.jpg" alt="" height="605" width="750"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. DVI
    2. VGA
    3. HDMI
    4. Composite

    Answer:

    A. The connector shown is a DVI connector used for digital video. More specifically, it is a DVI-I Dual Link connector capable of sending both analog and digital signals. The analog signals are ignored unless a DVI-I to VGA adapter is used to connect the PC to an older display using VGA. This makes the DVI-I connector more versatile than DVI-D connectors, but they are both considered digital interfaces.
19. What type of printer technology will often use a roll of paper as opposed to individual sheets?

    1. Inkjet
    2. Thermal
    3. Laser
    4. Fax machine

    Answer:

    B. Thermal printers will often use a roll of paper as opposed to individual sheets. Impact printers may also use rolls of paper but with tractor feed holes on the sides. Impact printers generally use multipart forms, since printing on multiple copies at once is their unique ability.
20. Which of the following types of printers does not require the replacement of some sort of ink or toner?

    1. Laser
    2. Thermal
    3. Impact
    4. Inkjet

    Answer:

    B. Laser printers need toner cartridges, impact printers need ink ribbons, and inkjet printers use ink cartridges. Thermal printers heat up paper to produce images.
21. You are working on repairing a defective laser printer. Which of the following is a true statement regarding the imaging drum in a laser printer?

    1. It can hold a high negative charge only when it's not exposed to light.
    2. It can hold a high negative charge only when it's exposed to light.
    3. It can hold a high negative charge regardless of light exposure.
    4. It is not required to hold a charge.

    Answer:

    A. An imaging drum is a photosensitive drum that can hold a high negative charge if it's not exposed to light. It is dark inside an electrophotographic (EP) printer, except when the laser scanning assembly shines on particular areas of the photosensitive drum, reducing the high negative charge to a much lower negative charge. Toner itself is negatively charged and repelled by the highly negative charged areas but attracted to the areas with a very low charge. The use of varying negative charges is what facilitates the printing process. When replacing a photosensitive drum, it's best to avoid exposing it to light.
22. What are the dimensions of a mini-ITX motherboard?

    1. 12″ × 9.6″
    2. 9.6″ × 9.6″
    3. 6.7″ × 6.7″
    4. 3.9″ × 2.8″

    Answer:

    C. Mini-ITX motherboards are 6.7" square (or more precisely, 6.69″ square). ATX motherboards are 12″ × 9.6″. A micro-ATX motherboard is a 9.6″ square, and pico-ITX motherboards are 3.9″ × 2.8″.
23. When discussing video displays, what is the term used to describe the number of pixels used to draw the screen?

    1. Refresh rate
    2. Frame rate
    3. Aspect ratio
    4. Resolution

    Answer:

    D. Resolution is the number of pixels used to draw a computer screen. Refresh rate determines how many times per second the screen can be redrawn. Frame rate tells you how many frames per second the original content was filmed in. Aspect ratio defines the dimensions (width × height) of an image.
24. You have three hard disks, each 1 TB in size. After installing them as a RAID-5 array in a computer, how much usable storage space will you have?

    1. 1.5 TB
    2. 2 TB
    3. 2.5 TB
    4. 3 TB

    Answer:

    B. In a RAID-5 array, each stripe places data on n–1 disks, and parity computed from the data is placed on the remaining disk. The parity is interleaved across all the drives in the array so that neighboring stripes have parity on different disks. Said differently, you lose the equivalent of one hard disk worth of storage to hold the parity information. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive (or Independent) Disks.
25. What hardware device is used to store encryption keys, making them safer because they are never directly loaded into a server's memory?

    1. HSM
    2. BIOS
    3. ITX
    4. TPM

    Answer:

    A. The Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a piece of hardware that can be removed and is used to hold encryption keys for a system. It differs from TPM (Trusted Platform Module) implementations in that TPM is a chip on the motherboard, not a separate piece of hardware, and TPM can also be software. TPM is used to encrypt hard drives. The BIOS (or UEFI) is the program the CPU uses to start up the system after being powered on. ITX is a motherboard form factor.
26. You need to enable clients to scan documents and place them on network accessible storage regardless of the multifunction device's location worldwide. Which service will best suit your needs?

    1. Bonjour
    2. AirPrint
    3. Virtual printing
    4. Cloud services

    Answer:

    D. Many modern multifunction devices have the ability to connect to a cloud and email and store scanned documents and images directly from the device without requiring a connected PC. The documents are made accessible worldwide via services such as Dropbox, Evernote, or Google Drive.
27. What is the most important consideration when installing a network connected multifunction device that is capable of directly scanning and emailing?

    1. Print quality
    2. Duplexing
    3. Security
    4. Speed

    Answer:

    C. The ability of multifunction devices to email and scan without a PC means that these devices need to be hardened the same way any other device with a network connection would. Secure protocols need to be present to protect sensitive corporate information.
28. What protocol is often used when scanning documents from a large multifunction device and sending them to the corporate server?

    1. TPM
    2. HSM
    3. SNMP
    4. SMB

    Answer:

    D. Server Message Block (SMB) is the secure protocol used when scanning documents from a multifunction device to a server. TPM and HSM are security encryption devices, not protocols. SNMP is Simple Network Management Protocol, used to gather information from managed switches and other devices across a network.
29. Identify the computer component shown here.

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c03uf004_0.jpg" alt="" height="554" width="750"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. CPU heat sink and fan
    2. Passive CPU heat sink
    3. Power supply fan
    4. Secondary cooling fan

    Answer:

    A. Heat sinks are often made of metal, with many fins on them to increase surface area and dissipate heat faster. Many modern CPU coolers will have both a fan (which requires power) and the finned metal heat sink. Passive heat sinks do not use power (so no fan), and secondary cooling fans are generally attached to the case.
30. What features are included in modern networked MFDs? (Choose all that apply.)

    1. Email
    2. Scanning
    3. Printing
    4. Faxing

    Answer:

    A, B, C, D. While faxing is not used as often as it once was, it is still a feature available on some MFDs. Email, scanning, and printing are also common features.
31. Which of the following connectors transmit analog signals? (Choose two.)

    1. VGA
    2. RJ-45
    3. RJ-11
    4. HDMI

    Answer:

    A, C. VGA is an analog video connector, and RJ-11 connectors are used with analog phone lines and modems. Modems receive a digital signal from a computer, then modulate that signal to analog to transmit over analog lines. On the other end, they demodulate the signal into a digital one again that a computer or other digital device can understand. RJ-45 connectors are used in networking, and HDMI carries digital audio and video signals.
32. Your partner wants to know what this port is on the back of their computer. What will you tell them?

    <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c03uf005_0.jpg" alt="" height="413" width="700"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. eSATA
    2. DisplayPort
    3. DVI port
    4. HDMI port

    Answer:

    B. The port shown is a DisplayPort. There is also a mini-DisplayPort, but that is not shown.
33. You have a motherboard that supports up-plugging. Which of the following statements regarding PCIe are true? (Choose two.)

    1. You can put an x1 card into an x8 slot.
    2. You can put an x8 card into an x16 slot.
    3. You can put an x8 card into an x1 slot.
    4. You can put an x16 card into an x8 slot.

    Answer:

    A, B. With up-plugging, you can put a smaller PCIe card into a larger slot, even though it does not fill it up completely. For example, you can insert an x8 card into an x16 slot. The x8 card won't completely fill the slot, but it will work at x8 speeds. It's important to note that a motherboard doesn't necessarily support this feature, so if you plan to use a smaller card in a larger PCIe slot, make sure the motherboard supports up-plugging or the card will run at 1x speed.
34. A technician needs to increase the fault tolerance of their computer's storage system, and they have two hard drives available. Which of the following options is their best choice?

    1. Install both drives and configure them as separate volumes.
    2. Install both drives and implement RAID-0.
    3. Install both drives and implement RAID-1.
    4. Install both drives and implement RAID-5.

    Answer:

    C. RAID-1 is called disk mirroring; it writes data simultaneously to both drives. If one drive fails, the other still has a working copy of the data. RAID-0 is disk striping and does not provide fault tolerance. RAID-5 is striping with parity and provides fault tolerance, but it requires a minimum of three hard disks.
35. During which step of the laser printer imaging process does a fluorescent lamp discharge the photosensitive drum?

    1. Cleaning
    2. Charging
    3. Exposing
    4. Developing

    Answer:

    A. During the cleaning step, a rubber blade inside the toner cartridge scrapes any toner left on the drum into a used toner receptacle, and a fluorescent lamp discharges any remaining charge on the imaging drum, making it neutral and ready to be charged again by the corona wire (or charging roller).
36. What type of front-panel or top-panel connector uses a standard 3.5 mm jack to make connections?

    1. USB
    2. Audio
    3. FireWire
    4. Thunderbolt

    Answer:

    B. The audio connector on the front-panel or top-panel will use a round, 3.5 mm connector. You can plug speakers or a headset with a boom microphone into it.
37. The motherboard in your desktop computer supports dual-channel memory. Which of the following statements regarding RAM in this motherboard are true? (Choose two.)

    1. The RAM will work only if it's installed in pairs.
    2. The RAM will work only if it's installed in pairs or if one double-sided RAM module is used.
    3. The RAM will work if only one module is installed but not in dual-channel mode.
    4. The RAM will work in dual-channel mode if two identical modules are installed.

    Answer:

    C, D. With most dual-channel motherboards, RAM will work just fine if one module is installed. However, you will get better performance if you fill the entire bank. If there is only one RAM module installed in one channel, then you can't possibly take advantage of the dual-channel architecture.
38. A customer wants you to upgrade their motherboard so that they can have the fastest video connection possible. They want to know how fast PCIe 4 is. What will you tell them the data rate of a single lane of PCIe 4 is?

    1. 250 MBps
    2. 500 MBps
    3. 1 GBps
    4. 2 GBps

    Answer:

    D. There are five major versions of PCIe currently specified: 1.x, 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0. Each version doubles the data transfer rate of the version before. For the four versions, a single bidirectional lane operates at a data rate of 250 MBps, 500 MBps, approximately 1 GBps, roughly 2 GBps, and nearly 4 GBps respectively. In any version of PCIe, there can be up to 16 lanes, so for example, in theory, a PCIe 4.0 x16 connector could transfer nearly 32 GB/s (1.969 GB/s per lane, x 16 lanes). You might find it helpful in your studies to locate or create a chart of the different versions and bandwidth for x1, x4, x8 and x16.
39. A technician needs to replace a failed power supply in a desktop computer. When choosing a replacement power supply, which two specifications are most important to consider? (Choose two.)

    1. Wattage
    2. Multiple rail
    3. Dual voltage options
    4. Number and type of connectors

    Answer:

    A, D. When installing or replacing a power supply, always make sure that it has enough wattage to power the components in the computer. In addition, it must have enough of the right connectors to connect to all the components that require their own power. Multiple rail and dual voltage are optional features.
40. You need to replace the magnetic hard drive in your manager's laptop. They want a high-speed, high-capacity drive. What are the most common issues associated with their request? (Choose two.)

    1. Increased battery usage
    2. Increased heat production
    3. Decreased component life span
    4. Decreased space for other peripherals

    Answer:

    A, B. Faster hard drives transfer more data than slower hard drives, but there is no specific correlation between hard drive speed and its life span. The downsides to faster hard drives can be increased battery usage and heat production.
41. You have a motherboard with a white expansion slot, that has a divider on the opposite end of a PCIe connector like the two shown in the image. What type of expansion slot is this?

    1. PCIe x1
    2. VESA
    3. PCI
    4. AGP

    Answer:

    C. The slot described is a PCI slot. It used a 32-bit or 64-bit bus. The first version was released in 1992, and they remained popular until PCIe was developed. Some motherboards have PCI and PCIe slots on them. PCI and PCIe are not physically compatible. VESA and AGP are legacy slots for video cards.
42. A designer from the corporate office is visiting your field office. The user tries to print from their MacBook Pro to a networked printer, but it does not work. Local users in the office are able to print to the device using their Windows computers. What would most likely solve the problem?

    1. Select the Enable Mac Printing option in the print server configuration settings.
    2. Select the Enable Bonjour option in the print server configuration settings.
    3. Install a macOS printer driver on the print server.
    4. Stop and restart the print spooler service.

    Answer:

    C. Print servers need to have the appropriate drivers for all operating systems that will be clients. It's possible that this print server does not have the macOS driver installed.
43. A user that you support needs to replace this cable. What type of peripheral connector, shown here, will you be looking for?

    3. USB Standard mini-B
    4. Thunderbolt

    Answer:

    B. The connector shown is USB Type B. It will plug into the USB peripheral device and is commonly used by printers.
44. Which of the following are advantages of using a CPU liquid cooling system over an air-based system? (Choose two.)

    1. Easier to install and maintain
    2. More efficient
    3. Quieter
    4. Safer for internal components

    Answer:

    B, C. Liquid cooling systems are generally quieter than air-based systems that use fans, and they are more efficient at cooling the processor. However, they are more complex to install, and if the liquid were to leak out, it could cause damage to internal components.
45. You need to perform preventive maintenance on an impact printer. What are two areas you should examine that you would not need to on most inkjet printers? (Choose two.)

    1. Ink cartridges
    2. Output tray
    3. Printhead
    4. Tractor feed mechanism

    Answer:

    C, D. Impact printers create images by physically striking the paper, which can wear down the printhead. Always check that. Also, impact printers most often use tractor-feed mechanisms to load the paper, and they can wear down or get bogged down by paper debris as well.
46. Which expansion bus technology uses lanes, which are switched point-to-point signal paths between two components?

    1. PCI
    2. PCI-X
    3. PCIe
    4. Mini-PCI

    Answer:

    C. PCIe uses lanes. Each lane between any two intercommunicating devices consists of a separate pair of wires, one for each direction of traffic, which dramatically increases speed.
47. A large display with a wide viewing angle is needed for a small conference room. Which type of LCD would be best?

    1. VA
    2. IPS
    3. LED
    4. Plasma

    Answer:

    B. Of the liquid crystal display (LCD) choices given, IPS have the better viewing angle. LCDs can be twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS), or vertical alignment (VA). VA has a greater contrast ratio, but it has a narrower viewing angle than IPS. TN is legacy technology. LED refers to a type of backlighting, and plasma displays are not a type of LCD.
48. You have a user who needs recommendations for installing a home server PC. They want their family to be able to share files and videos on their home network. They also want their data to be protected in the event of a hard drive failure. Which components do you recommend the system include? (Choose two.)

    1. Dedicated print server
    2. RAID array
    3. Gigabit NIC
    4. Dual processors

    Answer:

    B, C. A home server PC should be able to handle media streaming as well as file and printer sharing. A dedicated print server is not likely needed, though, as the operating system can function as a print server. A gigabit NIC will be helpful to manage the network traffic, and a RAID -1 or RAID 5 array can help recover from hard drive failure.
49. Your motherboard has 3 PCIe x16 v 4.0 slots and the motherboard does not support up-plugging for PCIe adapter cards. Which of the following statements is true?

    Answer:

    A. DDR3 DIMMs have 240 pins. DDR4 and DDR5 DIMMs have 288 pins, but they are not interchangeable and have notches (module keys) in different locations to prevent installing the incorrect modules into a motherboard. SODIMMs are laptop RAM, not desktop RAM.
52. DDR4 and DDR5 DIMMs have the same number of pins. How, then, can you tell the difference between the two?

    1. Placement of the module key (notch).
    2. Color of the module.
    3. Size of the module.
    4. DDR5 have heat sinks; DDR4 don't.

    Answer:

    A. The module key, also called a notch, on a DDR5 DIMM is at the center of the module whereas the DDR4 DIMM is slightly off center. Both are sold with heat sinks attached and come in multiple colors. Physically, they're the same size.
53. Which CPU technology allows for the assignment of two logical cores for every physical core present?

    1. Multicore
    2. 32-bit vs. 64-bit
    3. Integrated GPU
    4. Multithreading

    Answer:

    D. Multithreading is a feature of processors that divides physical processor cores into logical cores, and software processes into multiple threads that can be run concurrently on those logical cores. As a result, the operating system can schedule two processes at the same time on each physical core. Intel's implementation of multithreading is called hyperthreading.
54. You are adding paper to a printer that uses tractor-feed paper, which requires lining the holes up with pins on the paper-forwarding mechanism. What type of printer are you maintaining?

    1. Impact
    2. Thermal
    3. Laser
    4. Inkjet

    Answer:

    A. An impact printer typically requires paper that always feeds at a consistent rate. To achieve this, the paper will have holes on the outside edges, which is fed into the printer using a tractor-feed mechanism. Thermal printers use special paper and heat to create images, whereas laser printers use the electrophotographic process. Inkjet printers spray drops of ink onto paper.

    1. 1.7 V
    2. 3.3 V
    3. 5 V
    4. 6.6 V

    Answer:

    B, C. PCI slots and adapters are manufactured in 3.3 V and 5 V versions. Adapters are keyed to fit in a slot based on their voltage requirements. Universal adapters are keyed to fit in slots based on either of the two voltages. PCI has largely been replaced by PCIe, but there are still implementations of it, and it is still on the CompTIA A+ exam objectives.

    1. Duplexing
    2. Collating
    3. Print Quality
    4. Orientation

    Answer:

    A. Duplexing is printing on the front and back. Other common options or settings include orientation (portrait or landscape), collating (printing pages in sets such as 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3) and print quality (such as draft or high resolution).
73. A technician needs to install an optical disk system with capacity to burn disks storing about 60 GB of data at one time. What is the minimum technology required to get over this threshold?

    1. DVD-10
    2. DVD-18
    3. Triple BDXL
    4. Quad BDXL

    Answer:

    C. A Blu-ray Disc Extra Large (BDXL) can store up to 128 GB of data, (Quad BDXL) although most for sale boast only 100 GB of storage (Triple BDXL). Blu-ray is the latest rendition of optical disks, but DVDs are still available, and come in single layer (SL), dual layer (DL), single side (SS) and dual side (DS) formats. DVD-18 (DS, DL) hold approximately 16 GB of data. DVD-10 (DS, SL) can hold approximately 9GB, and DVD-9 (SS, DL) hold approximately 8 GB of storage. DVD-9 and DVD-10 can both be DVD+R or DVD-R format but DVD-18 can only be the DVD+R format.
74. Which home and office printing technology typically employs a reservoir of ink, contained in a cartridge that sometimes needs replacing, as its medium to form images on paper?

    1. Laser
    2. Thermal
    3. Inkjet
    4. Impact

    Answer:

    C. Inkjet printers typically use a reservoir of ink (also known as an ink cartridge), a pump, and a nozzle to print images. Empty cartridges need to be replaced.
75. You have been asked to purchase new RAM for three workstations. The workstations call for DDR4 3600 chips. What throughput will these modules support?

    1. 450 Mbps
    2. 1,800 Mbps
    3. 3,600 Mbps
    4. 28,800 Mbps

    Answer:

    D. The number designation of 3600 in DDR4 3600 indicates bus speed of 3,600 MHz. To find the throughput, multiply the bus speed by 8. DDR4 3600 therefore is the same as PC4 28,800 with a peak transfer rate of 28,800 Mbps. (3,600,000 cycles per second x 8 = 28,800,000 bits per second. Divide by 1000 to get Mbps = 28,800).
76. A technician needs to purchase new RAM for a motherboard. The motherboard specifications call for 5,200 MHz DDR5 RAM. Which RAM modules should the technician use?

    1. PC 5200
    2. PC 41600
    3. PC5 41600
    4. PC5 5200

    Answer:

    C. Multiply the 5200 bus speed by 8 to get the bits per second that can be transferred in and out of the RAM module. The PC5 designation means that it is DDR5, and the 41,600 means that it can (theoretically) transfer 41,600 Mbps (megabits per second).
77. On your network, users want to print easily from their iPads and iPhones. Which service supports this?

    1. Bonjour
    2. AirPrint
    3. TCP printing
    4. Virtual printing

    Answer:

    B. iPads and iPhones can automatically detect AirPrint-enabled printers on their local network and print to them without requiring the installation of a driver. Bonjour is a service that works with both Macs and Windows devices but requires some configuration. TCP printing uses an IP Address to connect to a printer. Virtual printing sends the output to something else such as a .`pdf` file.
78. You have a new computer that needs to communicate with other computers on a wireless network. What type of expansion card do you need to install?

    1. WAP
    2. NIC
    3. KVM
    4. WPA

    Answer:

    B. To communicate with other computers on a network, you need a network interface card (NIC). A wireless access point (WAP) is a wireless hub that many wireless devices communicate with, and WPA is a wireless security standard. A KVM switch allows you to have multiple systems attached to the same keyboard, video, and mouse. Other types of expansion cards (that could use the same slot as a NIC) include but are not limited to video cards, sound cards, storage cards, TV tuner cards, and riser cards.
79. When printing, which component is responsible for converting the data being printed into the format that the printer can understand?

    1. PDL
    2. Printer driver
    3. Print queue
    4. Print spooler

    Answer:

    B. The printer driver uses a page description language (PDL) to convert the data being printed into the format that the printer can understand. The driver also ensures that the printer is ready to print. PDL stands for page description language, which specifies the printed page layout. The print queue holds print jobs that are waiting to be printed, the print spooler manages the printing process, including locating the right printer driver.
80. You're installing a new printer and notice that the manufacturer has provided two drivers with the printer. One is a PostScript driver and the other is a Printer Control Language (PCL) driver. The user will mainly be printing graphics. Which driver should you install?

    1. Allow Windows to install its default driver.
    2. Install the PCL driver.
    3. Install the PostScript driver.
    4. Either driver will work equally well.

    Answer:

    C. Windows comes with many drivers for different devices, but if the manufacturer has provided a specific printer driver, it's often best to install that printer driver first, then connect the device. In this case, the user will be printing mostly graphics, so the PostScript driver will provide better printing for them. PostScript drivers are not dependent on the hardware, so the printed graphic will look the same regardless of what device it is printed on.
81. What type of printer driver is best to use if you'll be printing mostly documents and want to have the PC released to do other jobs more quickly?

    1. Allow Windows to install its default driver.
    2. Install the PCL driver.
    3. Install the PostScript driver.
    4. Driver choice won't have an effect.

    Answer:

    B. Printer Control Language (PCL) drivers depend on the printer hardware to create some of the effects such as filling in areas and making underlines. The PC releases the print job to the printer to finish, making the PC and application available to the user more quickly.
82. You notice that a fan on a power supply has stopped turning and you will need to replace it. Which of the following statements best describes the function of a typical power supply fan?

    1. It cools the power supply by blowing in air from outside the case.
    2. It cools the power supply by blowing hot air out the back of the power supply.
    3. It cools the computer by blowing in air from outside the case, through the power supply, and into the computer.
    4. It cools the computer by pulling hot air from inside the case, through the power supply, and blowing it out the back of the power supply, which in turn draws cooler air in through vents in the case.

    Answer:

    D. The power supply fan is used to cool the power supply and the inside of the computer case. This fan draws air from inside the case into vents in the power supply. This pulls hot air through the power supply so that it can be blown out of the case, which also causes cooler air to be drawn in through vents in the case.
83. A technician needs to install a new hard drive for their client. Access speed is far more important to this client than disk space. What type of hard drive is best suited for this client?

    1. SSD
    2. HDD
    3. SD
    4. BD-R

    Answer:

    A. A solid-state drive (SSD) is the best choice for a hard drive when access speed is the most important characteristic. A conventional magnetic hard disk drive (HDD) is slower. Secure Digital (SD) is a memory card format, not a hard drive type. BD-R is a Blu-ray disk format.

85. A technician has been asked to install and configure a RAID-10 array in a working computer that contains one hard drive. How many additional hard drives, at a minimum, do they need to bring to the job?

    1. One
    2. Two
    3. Three
    4. Four

    Answer:

    C. With RAID 10, drives are set up as mirrors, then those mirrors are striped. A minimum of two drives are needed to create a mirror, then another two to stripe the data for a total of four drives. The computer already has one drive in it. That drive would be mirrored, then striped, so three more drives are needed. RAID 10 provides both extra speed and fault tolerance.
86. You've been tasked with making a system faster, so you implement a RAID solution that does only that. What level of RAID will you implement?

    1. RAID-0
    2. RAID-1
    3. RAID-5
    4. RAID-10

    Answer:

    A. RAID-0 uses a minimum of two drives, writing different bits of data to each drive at the same time to improve speed, but it doesn't offer any fault tolerance. RAID-1 is disk mirroring, which provides some fault tolerance but no speed improvement. RAID-5 and RAID-10 improve both speed and fault tolerance.
87. Which CPU architecture term describes a CPU with multiple physical processor dies in the same package?

    1. Multicore
    2. 64-bit
    3. Integrated GPU
    4. Multiprocessor

    Answer:

    A. A processor that exhibits a multicore architecture has multiple completely separate processor dies in the same package. The operating system and applications see multiple processors in the same way that they see multiple processors in separate sockets. 64-bit refers to the width of the data bus. An integrated GPU means that the graphics processor is also on the CPU package, and multiprocessor refers to more than one physical socket on a motherboard.
88. Which of the following optical disk standards provides the highest capacity?

    1. DVD-R SS, SL
    2. DVD-R DS, SL
    3. DVD-R SS, DL
    4. DVD-R SS, TL

    Answer:

    B. All are digital video disk (DVD) technologies. A single-sided, single-layer (SS, SL) DVD provides about 4.7 GB of storage. A dual-sided (DS) disk will double that capacity to 9.4 GB. Adding a second layer, or dual-layer (DL), adds more capacity, but the technology does not double the capacity of a single layer. A single-sided, dual-layer (SS, DL) disk has a capacity of about 8.5 GB. There is no DVD-R SS, TL, but a DVD+R DS, DL holds nearly 17 GB of data. The -R refers to the encoding scheme. There is also a + R format. There are also number designations to identify how many sides and layers a DVD has. DVD-9 is single side, dual layer, DVD-10 is dual side, single layer, DVD-18 is dual side, dual layer.
89. Your company recently shipped five desktop computers from Germany to the United States. After switching the power cord to an American-style plug, you try to power one on and it doesn't work. You try the others and none of them power on either. What is the most likely cause?

    1. All of the computers were damaged during shipping.
    2. German power supplies work only with German power cords.
    3. The power supplies won't work because they expect 50 Hz frequency from the wall outlet and the United States standard is 60 Hz.
    4. The power supply voltage switch needs to be moved.

    Answer:

    D. Many power supplies have a two-position slider switch called a dual voltage switch. It can be set for 110–120 V or 220–240 V, depending on what local power specifications are.

    1. Laser
    2. Inkjet
    3. Dot-matrix
    4. Thermal

    Answer:

    C. Dot-matrix printers use printheads that strike an ink ribbon, which presses up against the paper to make an image. Therefore, they are impact printers. Laser printers use a photosensitive drum to create the image, inkjet printers use an ink reservoir (cartridge) and spray nozzles to produce an image on paper using dots of ink, and thermal printers use heat to produce an image on special heat-sensitive paper.
92. Which two CPU sockets are capable of supporting Intel Core i9 processors? (Choose two.)

    1. LGA1700
    2. LGA2066
    3. Socket AM3+
    4. Socket FM2

    Answer:

    A, B. Sockets that support Intel processors are currently named starting with the letters LGA, such as LGA1700 and LGA2066. Socket names that start with AM or FM will support AMD processors and not Intel processors.
93. You are discussing data storage needs with a client who is a videographer and media producer. They need to store dozens of large files and need immediate access to them for editing. What is the most appropriate storage technology for them to use?

    1. NAS
    2. SSD
    3. SD
    4. BD-R

    Answer:

    B. A solid-state drive (SSD) will provide them with the highest capacity of the four options and also give them immediate access. Network attached storage (NAS) speaks to its connection and availability, not capacity. If the client required file sharing as well, then using a NAS would be the proper choice. Secure Digital (SD) is a memory card format and does not offer the capacity or immediacy they need. BD-R is a Blu-ray disk format. It has good storage capabilities, but not the immediacy for editing.

96. A PCIe x1 v 3.0 lane provides how much data throughput?

    1. 250 MBps
    2. 500 MBps
    3. 1 GBps
    4. 2 GBps

    Answer:

    C. There are five major versions of PCIe currently specified: 1.x, 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. For the five versions, a single bidirectional lane operates at a data rate of 250 MBps, 500 MBps, approximately 1 GBps, roughly 2 GBps, and nearly 4 GBps, respectively. Each PCIe slot can have up to 16 lanes, the number of lanes being indicated by x1, x4, x8, x16. (The x is pronounced as _by_.) Therefore, a PCIe 3 x1 slot can support up to 1 GBps of bandwidth.
97. The toner is falling off every paper that comes out of a user's laser printer. Which component, responsible for heating up and melting the toner into the paper, do you need to replace?

    1. Transfer corona assembly
    2. Pickup rollers
    3. Exit assembly
    4. Fuser assembly

    Answer:

    D. Laser printers incorporate a fuser assembly, which uses two rollers that apply pressure and heat to fuse the plastic toner particles to the paper.
98. During which step in the laser printer imaging process does a wire or roller apply a strong, uniform negative charge to the surface of the imaging drum?

    1. Charging
    2. Conditioning
    3. Exposing
    4. Transferring

    Answer:

    A. During the charging step, the charging corona uses a high voltage to apply a strong, uniform negative charge (around –600 VDC) to the surface of the imaging drum.
99. You are installing two new RAM modules into a dual-channel motherboard. Which of the following is true?

    1. Both RAM modules need to have the same parameters.
    2. The RAM modules can be different sizes but must be the same speed.
    3. The RAM modules can be different speeds but must be the same size.
    4. The RAM modules can have different speeds and sizes, as long as they are the same type.

    Answer:

    A. When installing dual-channel RAM, be sure that the RAM modules both have the same parameters. In some cases, you might even need to make sure they come from the same manufacturer. RAM for channeled motherboards is often sold in packs such as a pack of two RAM modules for dual-channel motherboards, three modules for triple-channel motherboards, and four modules for quad-channel motherboards.
100.    Which of the following printer components is not found in a laser printer?

        1. Fuser assembly
        2. Imaging drum
        3. Transfer roller
        4. Carriage motor

        Answer:

        D. Carriage motors are components in inkjet printers. Laser printer components include a fuser assembly, imaging drum, transfer belt, transfer roller, pickup roller, separation pads, and a duplexing assembly.
101.    What type of common printer can potentially release harmful ozone into the atmosphere and therefore may contain an ozone filter?

        1. Laser
        2. Inkjet
        3. Thermal
        4. Impact

        Answer:

        A. A laser printer uses various high-voltage biases inside the case, and high voltages can create harmful ozone.
102.    There are four servers in your server closet. You need to access each of them, but not at the same time. Which device will allow you to share one set of input and output devices for all four servers?

        1. Touchscreen
        2. Docking station
        3. Set-top controller
        4. KVM switch

        Answer:

        D. The purpose of a KVM switch is to allow you to have multiple systems attached to the same keyboard, video display, and mouse. You can use these three devices with only one system at a time, and the KVM switch will have a dial or buttons to allow you to switch between systems.
103.    A user on your network has a laser printer that is several years old with no Ethernet connection. It's connected to their computer and shared on the network for others to use. Now, the user no longer wants the printer, but others still need to use it on the network. What would be the best upgrade to install in this printer to allow others to send print jobs to it directly over the network?

        1. A network card
        2. A print server
        3. TCP/IP printing
        4. AirPrint

        Answer:

        B. To get this printer off of the original user's desk, it probably needs to be its own print server. Installing an integrated (or stand-alone) print server with a network connection should work well in this situation. Installing a network card wouldn't take care of the sharing aspect of the problem. You need a network connection before you can use TCP/IP settings to connect to it. AirPrint is Apple's wireless printing, which would also need to have the printer connected to a wireless network.
104.    A technician needs to perform maintenance on an inkjet's dirty paper pickup rollers. What should they use to clean them?

        1. Rubbing alcohol
        2. Mild soap and water
        3. A dry, lint-free cloth
        4. Compressed air

        Answer:

        B. Clean pickup rollers (and other rubber rollers) with mild soap and water and not alcohol. Alcohol can dry out the rollers, making them brittle and ineffective. A dry cloth will not remove the dirt or debris, and compressed air would just blow the debris into other internal printer components.
105.    During which step in the laser printer imaging process is toner attracted to the imaging drum?

        1. Exposing
        2. Transferring
        3. Fusing
        4. Developing

        Answer:

        D. During the developing step, toner is attracted to areas of the drum where an image has been written by the laser. Those areas have a slight negative charge (–100 VDC) as opposed to unexposed areas of the drum and the developing roller (to which the toner is stuck), which each have a charge of –600 VDC.
106.    You are installing and configuring a magnetic hard drive and have several models to choose from. Which hard drive is most likely to have the highest data throughput rates?

        1. 500 GB, 7,200 rpm
        2. 750 GB, 5,400 rpm
        3. 750 GB, 10,000 rpm
        4. 1 TB, 7,200 rpm

        Answer:

        C. The primary factor in determining data throughput for a magnetic hard drive is the spin rate, which is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Higher spin rates will result in faster data reads and writes and increase data throughput.

        1. RAM
        2. PATA
        3. Mini-PCI
        4. ATX

        Answer:

        D. The white connector is a 20-pin ATX power connector. You will also see 24-pin versions, which have two rows of 12 pins each. The 24-pin versions are ATX12V. Whether 20 or 24 pin, these are often labeled P1.
108.    Your manager tells you to buy a high-capacity magnetic hard drive with the highest data transfer rate possible. Which hard drive parameter do manufacturers modify to increase hard drive data transfer rates?

        1. Read/write head size
        2. Connector size
        3. Spin rate (rpm)
        4. Platter size

        Answer:

        C. To make information available to the rest of the computer more quickly, hard drive manufacturers increase the speed at which the hard drive platters spin, which is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). The downside of higher speed is usually more heat generated by the drive, so faster hard drives may require additional cooling in the case.
109.    Three of these four motherboard form factors can be mounted in the same style of case. Which ones are they? (Choose three.)

        1. ATX
        2. MicroATX
        3. Mini-ITX
        4. Nano-ITX

        Answer:

        A, B, C. The ATX, MicroATX, and mini-ITX motherboard form factors can all be mounted inside a standard ATX case. The mini-ITX will have only three of the four mounting holes line up with the case, but the rear interfaces are placed in the same location as those on ATX motherboards.
110.    Which RAM feature can detect and possibly fix errors within memory?

        1. Parity
        2. Non-parity
        3. ECC
        4. Non-ECC

        Answer:

        C. If memory supports ECC, check bits are generated and stored with the data. If one of the eight memory bits is in error, ECC can correct the error. ECC tends to be more expensive than non-ECC memory, so it is more often found in servers than in workstations.
111.    You have a client who needs a hot-swappable, nonvolatile, long-term storage technology that lets them conveniently carry data from one location to another in their pocket. Which technologies can you recommend? (Choose two.)

        1. USB flash drive
        2. Hybrid SSD
        3. PATA
        4. SD

        Answer:

        A, D. USB flash drives and SD cards are hot swappable. (In the case of USB, be sure that the flash drive does not contain key file system files needed for the computer to run!) Hybrid SSDs might or might not be hot swappable and are larger than USB and SD drives. PATA devices are legacy technology and not hot swappable.
112.    What type of expansion slots are the first, third, and fifth slots (from the top down) on the motherboard shown here?

        1. PCIe x1
        2. PCIe x8
        3. PCIe x16
        4. PCI

        Answer:

        C. This SLI-ready motherboard has three PCIe x16 slots (every other slot, starting with the top one), one PCIe x1 slot (second slot from the top), and two PCI slots (first and third slots from the bottom). Notice the latch and tab that secures the x16 adapters in place by their hooks.
113.    You have been asked to assemble 20 new desktop PCs for a client. When you look at the first motherboard, you see four memory slots. The one closest to the CPU is colored blue. Then in order they are white, blue, and white. Which of the following statements are true? (Choose two.)

        1. This is a quad-channel motherboard.
        2. This is a dual-channel motherboard.
        3. For optimal performance, you should install RAM modules into the two slots closest to the CPU.
        4. For optimal performance, you should install RAM modules into the two blue slots.

        Answer:

        B, D. Dual-channel motherboards have two banks of two RAM slots. They are usually color-coded such that the two slots of the same color belong to different channels. For best performance, a RAM module needs to be installed into each channel, so two can be accessed at a time. It's always best to refer to the motherboard manual for proper RAM placement. Some motherboards will revert to single-channel mode if, for example, three RAM modules were placed in a dual-channel motherboard with four slots. Channels are typically marked with letters.
114.    You have a computer running Windows 10. Every time you boot, the computer insists on trying to boot from the USB drive. Where can you change the setting to have the system boot to the hard drive first?

        1. BIOS/UEFI
        2. Windows Configuration
        3. System Manager
        4. Device Manager

        Answer:

        A. The boot sequence of a computer is changed in the BIOS/UEFI settings.
115.    Which of the following types of connectors are generally found on the front or top panel of the computer? (Choose two.)

        1. SATA
        2. PCIe
        3. Power button
        4. USB

        Answer:

        C, D. Typical front- or top-panel connectors include USB, audio, power button, power light, drive activity lights, and the reset button. SATA and PCIe connectors are found inside the case, on the motherboard.
116.    Your manager is excited because they just purchased a fast USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 external hard drive for their work team. They want to set it in the middle of the cubicles and let everyone have access to it. Some of the cubicles are about 15 feet away from each other. What is the recommended maximum cable length for this type of device?

        1. 3 meters
        2. 5 meters
        3. 10 meters
        4. 15 meters

        Answer:

        A. The USB 3.0 standard doesn't specify a cable length limitation, but it does recommend a cable length of 3 meters or less. USB 2.0 cables can be up to 5 meters in length. USB4 cables should be only 0.8 meters. The manager will need a USB hub, and to extend the distance the manager could purchase active USB cables, some of which have an external power supply or extra USB A connector for extra power, or a Cat 5/Cat 6 USB extender.
117.    A technician has just installed an automatic document feeder (ADF) on a laser printer. The ADF was sold by the manufacturer and is compatible with the printer. However, the printer doesn't pull the papers from the feeder. What might resolve the issue?

        1. Removing and reinstalling the duplexing assembly
        2. Turning the printer off and back on
        3. Upgrading the printer's firmware
        4. Stopping and restarting the spooler service

        Answer:

        C. Depending on the printer, you may be able to update the printer's information in Devices and Printers; otherwise, a firmware update may be needed. Firmware upgrades can offer newer features that are not available on previous versions.
118.    A medical office needs to make all old records available electronically. What device can they install on their printer to make scanning hundreds of documents go more quickly?

        1. High-capacity paper tray
        2. Flatbed scanner
        3. Duplexing assembly
        4. Automatic document feeder

        Answer:

        D. An automatic document feeder (ADF) is a device that sits on top of a flatbed scanner. It is used to pull a stack of papers through and scan them one at a time without user intervention. Some MFDs will scan the front and back of the paper at the same time.
119.    You have a desktop computer with three PCI expansion slots. What will happen when you mix cards of different speeds on the same motherboard?

        1. The cards will operate at their original speeds.
        2. None of the cards will function.
        3. The cards will all operate at the faster speed.
        4. The cards will all operate at the slower speed.

        Answer:

        D. PCI is a shared-bus topology, so mixing 33 MHz and 66 MHz adapters in a 66 MHz system will slow all adapters to 33 MHz.
120.    Which of the following statements accurately explains what happens during the exposing step in the laser printer imaging process?

        1. A laser reduces areas of the drum from a strong negative charge to a slight positive charge.
        2. A laser reduces areas of the drum from a strong negative charge to a slight negative charge.
        3. A laser increases areas of the drum from a slight negative charge to a strong negative charge.
        4. A laser increases areas of the drum from a slight positive charge to a strong positive charge.

        Answer:

        B. In the exposing step, the image is written to the photosensitive imaging drum. Wherever the laser beam touches, the photosensitive drum's charge is severely reduced from –600 VDC to a slight negative charge (around –100 VDC). As the drum rotates, a pattern of exposed areas is formed, representing the image to be printed.
121.    Which of the following is the defining characteristic of a passive heatsink cooling system for a CPU?

        3. Duplexing assembly
        4. Rear paper feed assembly

        Answer:

        C. A duplexing assembly is used for two-sided printing. After the first page is printed, it's fed into the duplexing assembly, turned over, and fed back into the paper feed assembly.
127.    Which component in a laser printer is responsible for converting AC current into usable energy for the logic circuitry and motors? (Choose two.)

        1. LVPS
        2. HVPS
        3. DCPS
        4. ACPS

        Answer:

        A, C. The DC power supply (DCPS), also sometimes called the low voltage power supply (LVPS), provides power for the logic boards and motors, whereas the high voltage power supply (HVPS) provides higher voltages for the toner transfer process. The printer's logic circuitry and motors require low voltages, between +5 VDC and +24 VDC. The DC power supply (DCPS) converts house current into three voltages: +5 VDC and –5 VDC for the logic circuitry and +24 VDC for the paper-transport motors. This component also runs the fan that cools the internal components of the printer.

138.    You need to create several UTP cables from a roll of bulk cable. Your company uses the T568B standard. What is the correct order for wires in the connectors?

        1. White/orange, orange, white/green, blue, white/blue, green, white/brown, brown
        2. White/orange, orange, white/green, green, white/blue, blue, white/brown, brown
        3. White/orange, green, white/green, blue, white/blue, orange, white/brown, brown
        4. Orange, white/orange, white/green, blue, white/blue, green, white/brown, brown

        Answer:

        A. The correct order for a T568B cable is white/orange, orange, white/green, blue, white/blue, green, white/brown, brown. In the T568A standard, the orange and green cables are swapped. The blue and brown wires don't change position between the two standards.
139.    You are installing network cable that will support digital cable television signals. What type of cable should you install?

        1. RG-6
        2. RG-8
        3. RG-58 A/U
        4. RG-59

        Answer:

        A. Cable television installations typically use RG-6 but may also use RG-59 cable. RG-6 is slightly thicker, can run longer distances, and supports digital signals. RG-59 is suited only for analog TV signals and is used for some security cameras.
140.    You need to replace a faulty 250-foot section of RG-6 cable, but all you have available is RG-59. Which of the following statements is true?

        1. The replacement cable will not work because the distance exceeds RG-59 specifications.
        2. The replacement cable will not work because RG-6 and RG-59 use different connectors.
        3. The replacement cable will not work because RG-6 and RG-59 have different impedance.
        4. If the replacement cable works, it won't work as well. RG-6 should be purchased.

        Answer:

        D. RG-6 is a better choice because it supports digital signals and has a longer range (304 meters, or 1,000 feet). RG-59 can run up to 228 meters (750 feet). Both have impedance of 75 ohms, and both use BNC connectors or F-type connectors. RG-6 is usually better insulated and will have less signal loss. While the RG-59 might work, if it doesn't, would you want to do the job over?
141.    You have been asked to design a new network that requires 10 Gbps transmission speeds. Which cable types will meet the minimum specifications? (Choose two.)

        1. MMF
        2. Cat 5
        3. Cat 5e
        4. Cat 6a

        Answer:

        A, D. Multimode fiber (MMF) and unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Cat 6 and newer support 10 Gbps transmission speeds. Cat 5 supports up to 100 Mbps, and Cat 5e supports up to 1,000 Mbps.
142.    What characteristic differentiates STP from UTP?

        1. STP uses RJ-45s connectors instead of RJ-45.
        2. STP follows the T568A wiring standard.
        3. STP does not produce poisonous gas when burned.
        4. STP has a layer of foil shielding inside the cable insulation.

        Answer:

        D. Shielded twisted pair (STP) cabling has a foil shield surrounding the wire pairs to decrease electrical interference. Some STP cables also shield individual wire pairs. Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) does not have the shielding. Both types use RJ-45 connectors, can follow the T568A wiring standard, and can be produced as plenum-rated cable that does not produce poisonous gas when burned.

        1. ST
        2. SC
        3. LC
        4. MFF

        Answer:

        B. The connector shown is a subscriber connector (SC), also known as a square connector because of its shape. It's a fiber-optic cable connector. ST and LC are also types of fiber-optic connectors, and MFF is multimode fiber-optic cable.
145.    While cleaning out a storage room, a technician finds several rolls of Cat 5e network cable. The technician thinks they might be able to use it to create replacement cables for their network. What is the maximum speed that this cable will support?

        1. 100 Mbps
        2. 1 Gbps
        3. 10 Gbps
        4. 20 Gbps

        Answer:

        B. Cat 5e cable can support speeds of 1 Gbps. Cat 5 has a maximum of 100 Mbps. Cat 6 and newer can support 10 Gbps. Cat 8 cabling can support speeds around 40 Gbps, but only for short distances. To run at a given speed, all components of the network must support that speed, including NICs, cable, routers, and switches.
146.    You are replacing cabling in a network. The existing cable was only capable of 100 Mbps maximum speed. What type of cable are you replacing?

        1. Cat 5
        2. Cat 5e
        3. Cat 6a
        4. Single mode

        Answer:

        A. Cat 5 UTP can transmit data at speeds up to 100 Mbps, for a distance of 100 meters. Cat 5e is capable of 1 Gbps. Cat 6 and newer can support 10 Gbps. Single mode is a type of fiber-optic cable and is very fast.
147.    You are installing UTP network cable for a client. The client's policies require that network cables do not produce poisonous gas when burned. What type of cable do you need to install?

        1. Plenum
        2. PVC
        3. STP
        4. Cat 5e or higher

        Answer:

        A. Most network cables are coated with a plastic PVC coating, which produces toxic gas when burned. Plenum-rated cables are coated with a Teflon-like material that is not poisonous when burned.
148.    You are trying to replace a hard drive in an older system. The connector has 68 pins, along two rows. You believe from the printing on the motherboard that it is a 16-bit connection. What type of drive do you have to replace?

        1. SATA
        2. ATA
        3. SCSI
        4. NVMe

        Answer:

        C. The 16-bit SCSI drives were connected by a Molex type connector, two rows of pins, totaling 68 pins.
149.    A technician has a tablet whose documentation says it can connect to an HDMI display. However, the tablet has a port far smaller than HDMI. What type of video connection would be typical for this small form factor device?

        1. USB-C
        2. RS-232
        3. DB-9
        4. Mini-HDMI

        Answer:

        D. On small form factor devices like tablets, the video-out connector is the small version of HDMI: mini-HDMI. It resembles a USB-C but is still tapered on only one side. To connect to an HDMI display, you would need a mini-HDMI-to-HDMI adapter.
150.    What was the connectivity port/cable end Apple used to replace the 30-pin dock connector beginning in 2012?

        1. RS-232
        2. Mini-HDMI
        3. Micro-USB
        4. Lightning

        Answer:

        D. Lightning was introduced in autumn 2012 and still works on the Apple 13, released in 2021. RS-232 is a type of serial connection that dates back to 1960. Mini-HDMI is a smaller version of HDMI for smaller devices and will require a mini-HDMI-to-HDMI adapter to plug in a display. MicroUSB is a type of USB connector that was popular for a time.
151.    With what connection standard is the Apple Thunderbolt 3 cable fully compatible?

        1. USB-C
        2. Mini-HDMI
        3. Micro-USB
        4. DB9

        Answer:

        A. Thunderbolt 3 cables work as USB-C cables and are fully compatible. Thunderbolt 3 are capable of transferring at 40 Gbps, but USB 3.1 (on USB-C) can only reach 10 Gbps. USB4 is able to reach 40 Gbps.
152.    Which of the following connection types can be inserted or first flipped over and inserted?

        1. DB9
        2. RS232
        3. Micro-USB
        4. USB-C

        Answer:

        D. USB-C is the only one of these that can be inserted correctly both as you try the first time or flip over and try again. Micro-USB resembles USB-C but it is not “flippable”—one edge is slightly tapered. DB9 and RS232 are legacy serial connectors.
153.    What serial connector type was commonly used for communication, keyboards, mice, or game controllers before USB became popular?

        1. SCSI
        2. PS/2
        3. DB9
        4. Lightning

        Answer:

        C. DB9 was the “D” format, 9-pin serial connector type that was the standard format for keyboards, mice, and other small peripherals. It was also used for communications between a PC and some managed switches. Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) is a type of drive connector and technology that would allow up to 15 drives on one daisy chain. The PS/2 connector, also called a mini-DIN, is newer than a DB9 connector but older than USB. It has 6 pins and was used for connecting mice (color-coded green) and keyboards (color-coded purple). Lightning connectors are used on Apple devices.
154.    Which of the following does not apply with triple channel memory?

        1. Triple the 64-bit communication path to the CPU
        2. Triple the speed with which memory is accessed
        3. Requires installation of three matched memory modules
        4. Triple the memory access latency

        Answer:

        D. Triple channel memory is achieved when three matching memory modules are installed, permitting data to be spread and memory accessed simultaneously. The effect is lower memory latency, triple the access speed (compared to single channel), and triple the 64-bit communication path.
155.    What form factor for solid-state hard drives measures 22 mm wide with lengths varying between 30 mm, 42 mm, 60 mm, and longer?

        1. NVMe
        2. SATA
        3. PCIe
        4. M.2

        Answer:

        D. M.2 is a solid-state hard drive form factor, measuring 22 mm wide. Its lengths vary between 30 mm, 42 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, and 120 mm. NVMe is a storage protocol, not a form factor. Many M.2 drives use the NVMe protocol. SATA and PCIe are bus interface standards found on a motherboard.
156.    What form factor for solid-state hard drives has dimensions that mirror the older, platter-type magnetic drives?

        1. M.2
        2. mSATA
        3. 2.5″
        4. NVMe

        Answer:

        C. Solid-state drives (SSDs) come in multiple form factors, such as a “stick” resembling a memory module (M.2) or a 2.5″ box housed in metal. SSDs also come in 3.5″ form factor. M.2 and mSATA are form factors for SSDs. NVMe is a protocol for storing data that is commonly used with M.2 drives, although M.2 drives can also use the older Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI).
157.    You want to connect a 3.5″ external hard drive to your computer. What port is used to connect external drives to the SATA bus?

        1. NVMe
        2. eSATA
        3. M.2
        4. mSATA

        Answer:

        B. eSATA is external SATA, a type of connector for external SATA drives. Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a protocol and communications interface designed to connect small SSD storage to the PCIe bus of a motherboard. The Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) technology preceded NVMe, and was much slower. M.2 and mSATA are form factors for SSDs that connect directly to a motherboard. An mSATA drive looks similar to M.2, but the connectors are slightly different and mSATA only connects to the slower SATA bus using AHCI technology. M.2 drives can be either NVMe or AHCI, so checking documentation is important.
158.    You wish to protect your system from someone not authorized to start the OS. What is your best option?

        1. Password-protect the locked screen.
        2. Password-protect in the BIOS/UEFI settings.
        3. Encrypt the hard drive.
        4. Use a 12-character login password.

        Answer:

        B. The system BIOS/UEFI settings include password protection to not allow system bootup unless someone enters a password. This would prohibit the OS from loading upon boot.
159.    What is used to ensure an efficient and effective heat exchange away from the CPU?

        1. Thermal paste
        2. High-tension clamps to heat sink
        3. Dihydrogen monoxide coolant
        4. Lower CPU speeds

        Answer:

        A. Thermal paste is like a grease that ensures that the heat generated from the CPU is efficiently conducted away and into the heat sink. New coolers (fan/heat sink combinations) often come with thermal pads (paste) preinstalled. Lowering the CPU speed might result in less heat generated, but it would obviously also result in degraded performance.
160.    If you require more USB ports than your system can provide, what is your most cost-effective option?

        1. Install a USB expansion card.
        2. Swap peripherals for those requiring different connectors.
        3. Replace the motherboard for one with additional USB ports.
        4. Swap out peripherals as you use them.

        Answer:

        A. A USB expansion card would utilize an expansion slot on the motherboard to provide two to four additional USB ports. Not included as an option, but a USB hub is a cost-effective fix as well, and some will provide additional power for USB-powered devices.
161.    What technology allows you to generate a tangible product from a computer-aided drafting application?

        1. Smartcard reader
        2. 3D printer
        3. Touchpad
        4. VR headset

        Answer:

        B. The 3D printer can be attached locally or, if allowed by the manufacturer, accessible by shared network. There are many different methods and materials used for 3D printing, but the CompTIA A+ objectives want you to know about the following two of them. 3D printers use either an extruder and filament to create a 3D object by heating the plastic filament and extruding one layer at a time through a nozzle as the nozzle and print bed move, or they use a vat of resin that is hardened with a laser, then the excess resin washed away leaving the 3D object. A smartcard reader is used to integrate smartcards as an authentication factor for your system. A touchpad coupled with finger movement on it can be used to replace mouse input. A VR headset is used for experiencing virtual reality.
162.    You need to purchase RAM for a computer. Which factors determine the speed of memory you should purchase? (Choose two.)

        1. CPU speed
        2. RAM speed supported by the motherboard
        3. RAM speed supported by the processor
        4. RAM speed supported by the TPM chip

        Answer:

        B, C. The speed of RAM that a computer can use is limited by the speed of the motherboard's memory bus and the speed of RAM supported by the processor, especially now that the memory controller is part of the processor. Even if faster RAM is purchased, it will run at the slower speed of the memory bus or what the processor supports.
163.    You installed a new motherboard because the previous one failed. Your new motherboard doesn't have a VGA display port; it has onboard HDMI. Your display only uses VGA. What is the least expensive option to resolve this dilemma?

        1. Purchase a new display.
        2. Return the motherboard and choose a different one.
        3. Purchase a video card with a VGA port on it.
        4. Purchase an HDMI-to-VGA adapter.

        Answer:

        D. Although the more fun answer is to purchase a new display, the question asks what would be the least expensive, and that is to purchase an HDMI-to-VGA adapter. There are adapters for almost everything on a computer system, so in a case like this, that would be the quickest and least expensive solution.
164.    What type of printer will most likely have an extruder as one of its components?

        1. 3D printer
        2. Impact
        3. Thermal
        4. Laser

        Answer:

        A. There are several types of 3D printers. Material extrusion printers work by pushing material through a nozzle as the nozzle and possibly a print bed move to place the material. The materials used are as diverse as plastic, metal, and human tissue. Vat polymerization 3D printers use a light source to harden resin in a vat. When the liquid is drained away, the hardened product remains. Powder bed fusion types deposit one thin layer of material at a time that is hardened where needed. Each of these has subtypes, and this is not an exhaustive list of the types of 3D printers.
165.    Your company owns a 3D printer and has asked you to order the consumable materials for it. It is an extrusion type printer that is used to make small plastic parts. What is the material called that you'll order for it?

        1. Toner
        2. Ink
        3. Filament
        4. Resin

        Answer:

        C. Extrusion type 3D printers heat material called filament from a roll and force it through a narrow nozzle while the nozzle is moved to the appropriate spot to build an object layer by layer. Filament is available in different thickness and characteristics, so it's important to verify exactly what type of filament the printer uses before ordering it.
166.    You've been asked to replace some UTP network cable with other UTP cable that is capable of 10 Gbps. The longest drop is 75 meters from the network rack. What is the lowest category of cable that can meet your needs?

        1. Cat 5
        2. Cat 5e
        3. Cat 6
        4. Cat 6a

        Answer:

        D. Cat 6 and newer can support 10 Gbps, but Cat 6 can only go 55 meters at 10 Gbps. To go 100 meters you'll need Cat 6a. Cat 5e's top speed is 1 Gbps, and Cat 5 is only 100 Mbps.
167.    You need to update a twisted pair cable that runs between two networking closets. The total distance is only 20 meters, and it needs to run at 10 Gbps. What is the lowest category of cable that you can replace it with?

        1. Cat 6
        2. Cat 6a
        3. Cat 7
        4. Cat 8

        Answer:

        A. Category 6 cable will work for the implementation described. It is capable of 10 Gbps but only for a distance of 55 meters. Category 6a can go 100 meters at 10 Gbps. Cat 7 is not an IEEE standard, nor is it approved by TIA/EIA, and it doesn't use a standard RJ45 connector. Cat 8 is IEEE approved; it can support 10 Gbps over 100 meters and can support 40 GBps, but only over very short distances (24 meters), which makes it good for things like a storage area network (SAN). Cat 7 and Cat 8 are not on the CompTIA A+ objectives this time, so don't spend too much time on them right now.
168.    Your friend wants to run cable for a PoE WAP in their workshop, which is about 100 feet from the network connection in their house. They're not sure how to go about it, but they know that they don't want to have wires overhead. They also want to make sure it is shielded. What type of cable can you suggest that can go that far and has superior insulation and a water blocking layer?

        1. Cat 7
        2. Direct burial STP
        3. UTP Cat 10
        4. Cat 6e

        Answer:

        B. Direct burial cable is made to go underground without any kind of conduit around it. The coating is made to be waterproof and block moisture vapor as well. A good cable will also protect against degradation from sunlight.
169.    What are advantages of UTP over STP? (Choose two.)

        1. UTP is more flexible.
        2. UTP can run faster.
        3. UTP can be buried.
        4. UTP is less expensive.

        Answer:

        A, D. Shielded twisted pair (STP) has at least one extra layer of shielding to protect the cable from crosstalk and interference. Some types of STP have shielding around each wire. With all the extra material, STP tends to be less flexible and more expensive than unshielded twisted pair (UTP). Being shielded or unshielded doesn't affect the maximum transmission speed of a cable, and UTP is not suitable for direct burial.
170.    What type of network cable uses pulses of light to transmit data instead of an electrical charge?

        1. STP
        2. Coaxial
        3. Plenum
        4. Fiber-optic

        Answer:

        D. Only fiber-optic cables use pulses of light to transmit data. The other three listed are types of copper cable that use electrical charges to transmit data signals.
171.    What type of data cable transmits data only one bit at a time, but very fast?

        1. Plenum
        2. Serial
        3. Parallel
        4. Ethereal

        Answer:

        B. Data transmissions can be parallel, meaning multiple bits at the same time in parallel with each other, or they can be serial, meaning only one bit at a time. It would seem that parallel transmissions should be faster, but they aren't. In fact, modern peripheral and hard drive cables all send data in series.
172.    What type of connector is the one shown?

        <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c03uf018_0.jpg" alt="" height="418" width="701"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        1. SATA
        2. eSATA
        3. HDMI
        4. SATAe

        Answer:

        B. eSATA connectors provide a way to access the SATA bus via an external connector. Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) is a type of internal drive connection and bus that replaced the older parallel ATA (PATA). SATAe is a motherboard bus that supports both SATA and PCIe. HDMI is an audio/video interface.

        1. UPS
        2. SATA
        3. IDE
        4. eSATA

        Answer:

        C. Integrated Device Electronics (IDE) cables were used to connect parallel ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) drives to a motherboard. PATA cables had 40 connector pins and could connect two hard drives per cable. Most motherboards at the time had two IDE connectors, so they were capable of connecting four IDE hard drives. PATA were replaced by serial ATA (SATA) drives and cables, which are much faster and only connect one drive per cable, simplifying installation. Several SATA connectors can be on a single motherboard. IDE and ATA are often used interchangeably, although they aren't exactly the same. IDE was the parallel interface that used an ATA protocol. SATA is a serial, as opposed to a parallel, ATA connection. A UPS is an uninterruptible power supply, and eSATA is external SATA.
174.    You have a motherboard that has 16 RAM slots. It is a quad-channel, with four RAM slots for each channel. The slots are all black, but they are labeled A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, and so on. To take advantage of the quad-channel feature, how will you install the RAM modules?

        1. Any four slots will work for quad channel.
        2. Install them all in the “A” slots.
        3. Install them in A1, B2, C3, and D4.
        4. Install them in A1, B1, C1, and D1.

        Answer:

        D. Typically in a motherboard with multichannel support, the channels will be labeled with a letter (A, B, C, D). To take advantage of the multichannel capabilities, you would install one RAM module in each channel. Lowest numbered slots are usually filled first, so you would use slot 1 (or zero, if numbering started there) of each channel. You should, of course, always consult the motherboard documentation.
175.    You've maxed out the physical RAM on a motherboard but need more to run a particular app. The operating system will let you adjust a setting so that you can use some of the hard drive as if it were physical RAM, and the OS will swap data between RAM and the hard drive in a unit called a page. What type of memory are you using?

        1. Virtual
        2. DIMM
        3. SODIMM
        4. Cache

        Answer:

        A. A part of the hard disk drive (or SDD) being used as if it was RAM is known as virtual memory. Virtual memory works by moving a chunk of information, called a page, to a file named `pagefile.sys`. `pagefile.sys` is literally the file on the hard drive where information in virtual memory is stored. Because of this, virtual memory is sometimes called the page file or paging file. It isn't as fast to access as actual RAM, but it will allow some programs to run that wouldn't otherwise. DIMMs and SODIMMs and Cache are types of physical memory. DIMMs are used in desktop computers, SODIMMs are used in laptops, and cache resides on the processor die.

        1. Hub
        2. Switch
        3. Router
        4. Punchdown block

        Answer:

        D. This is a punchdown block. It can be found in a telecommunications closet mounted on a networking rack. Network drops from work areas are terminated (punched down) in the back, and cables with RJ-45 connectors connect the front to a switch or router.
177.    What is the purpose of a Molex connector?

        1. Parallel data communications
        2. Serial data communications
        3. Power connections
        4. Fan connectors on the motherboard

        Answer:

        C. Molex connectors have a metal sleeve inside a plastic housing. Technically they can come in any number of connections but those used most often in computer systems are 4 pin, 6 pin, 8 pin, and 20/24 pin. They are used to provide power to various devices and the motherboard.
178.    You have an extruder type 3D printer. What two components of the printer are likely to move as the print job progresses? (Choose two.)

        1. Extruder nozzle
        2. Print bed
        3. Platform
        4. Resin tray

        Answer:

        A, B. In many extruder type 3D printers, the print bed will move down as the print job progresses and may move front to back during the printing of each layer, while the extruder nozzle moves left to right, building the 3D object one layer at a time.
179.    What are the two types of connectors shown here, left to right?

        <figure><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/1713084894.e6f6e038ed4648f14e86ea4941451aabb2eb879f/eod/books/159469/images/c03uf021_0.jpg" alt="" height="799" width="673"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        1. MicroUSB, miniUSB
        2. MiniUSB, microUSB
        3. USB-A, USB-B
        4. USB-C, USB4

        Answer:

        B. The connector on the left is a miniUSB, and on the right is a microUSB.
180.    What type of drive is likely to be a 15,000 rpm drive?

        1. NVMe
        2. SSD
        3. Blu-ray
        4. Magnetic

        Answer:

        D. NVMe and SSD drives don't have platters that spin. Blu-ray optical discs spin, but their spin speed is not how they are measured. Only magnetic drives are measured in rpms, and 15,000 would be a very fast magnetic drive.
181.    What type of hard drives are not available in a 3.5″ form factor?

        1. SSD
        2. mSATA
        3. SATA
        4. Magnetic

        Answer:

        B. SSDs and magnetic drives can both be found in the 3.5″ form factor that is used in desktop computers, and often they connect via a SATA interface. mSATA and M.2 are solid-state drives consisting of a very small circuit board that connects directly to the motherboard via a slot with a screw or connector to hold it in place.
182.    What keys are used for M.2 slots? (Choose two.)

        1. A
        2. B
        3. E
        4. M

        Answer:

        B, D. M.2 drives are keyed with B or M or B+M keys. A and E keys are for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular devices such as networking cards found in laptops. In computers, a key is a device such as a notch, an indent on a circuit board, that ensures you can't plug the wrong type of device into something. Power connectors are keyed by shape, RAM modules are keyed with notches in different places, CPUs will have keys, SATA connectors have an L shape for a key, and M.2 drives are keyed as well. In an M.2, a B key is for PCIe x 2/SATA/USB and so on, and an M key is PCIe x4/SATA.
183.    Which version of SATA ties SATA drives into the PCIe bus on the motherboard, boosting the data throughput far beyond 600 MBps?

        1. SATA 1
        2. SATA 2
        3. SATA 3.2
        4. SATA 4

        Answer:

        C. SATA 3 had a speed of 6 Gbps and a data throughput of 600 MBps, but SATA 3.2 (also called SATAe) ties compatible drives into the PCIe bus on the motherboard, decreasing overhead and taking advantage of the PCIe bus speeds which makes the data throughput multiple times better.
184.    Which of the following are AMD socket types? (Choose two.)

        1. Socket AM4
        2. LGA 1200
        3. Socket TR4
        4. LGA 2066 Socket R4

        Answer:

        A, C. Socket AM4 and Socket TR4 are only compatible with AMD processors. The two LGA sockets listed are for use with Intel processors only.
185.    What connects in the motherboard socket shown here?

        1. Multicore
        2. Multithreaded
        3. Coprocessor
        4. Multisocket

        Answer:

        D. This is a multisocket motherboard, meaning that it has sockets for more than one processor. The other three terms describe characteristics of processors. Multicore is more than one core on a die. Multithreaded means each core can perform more than one string of code at a time, and a coprocessor is usually a chip designed to perform a specific function to help a processor be more efficient.
187.    What type of motherboard may have multiple processors and plenty of RAM, and can sometimes be found mounted in a networking rack?

        1. Server
        2. Workstation
        3. Desktop
        4. Mobile

        Answer:

        A. Servers often perform more work than any other computer on a network, especially in a virtualization environment. A server could be as simple as an ordinary desktop computer, but more often the server will have extra processing power and loads of RAM, and be rack-mounted for easy access by technicians in a corporate environment.
188.    Which of the following processors are you more likely to find in a server than a workstation? (Choose two.)

        1. Intel Atom
        2. Intel Xeon
        3. AMD EPYC
        4. AMD Ryzen 3

        Answer:

        B, C. Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC processors are designed to be high-end server processors. The Atom processor is a small form factor processor, and the Ryzen 3 is a desktop processor.
189.    What type of motherboard is designed to be very compact and is generally proprietary?

        1. Server
        2. Workstation
        3. Desktop
        4. Mobile

        Answer:

        D. Motherboards found in smaller devices such as laptops and cell phones tend to be very proprietary, meaning that if you can replace them, you must replace them with a board made by the same manufacturer for that precise device.
190.    Which of the following are true about ARM architecture? (Choose two.)

        1. It's licensed by ARM Holdings to many chip manufacturers.
        2. It uses Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC).
        3. It uses Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC).
        4. It is only found in smartphones.

        Answer:

        A, C. Arm Holdings, LTD. is the company that has developed the nine iterations of ARM processors. ARM is famous for developing Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC), and their intellectual property can be found in everything from embedded systems and smartphones all the way up to servers. An ARM processor is considered a SoC (system-on-a-chip) rather than a CPU because processors are built with various features around the ARM processor.
191.    You work in a secure environment and it's your responsibility to ensure that no data leaves the network. You've just received a batch of new computers in. What can you do in the UEFI to help ensure users can't copy data to a USB drive?

        1. Look for a setting to disable USB ports and disable them.
        2. Put USB ports first in the boot options.
        3. Remove USB from the boot options.
        4. Look for a setting to enable USB ports and enable them.

        Answer:

        A. If you disable the USB ports, a user won't be able to attach a USB drive to copy files. Removing USB from the boot options will keep them from booting to it, but it won't prohibit someone from using a USB drive. You can also purchase USB drive locks, which are little plugs for the USB ports. Just don't lose your key!

        2. SATA
        3. EEPROM
        4. Power

        Answer:

        B. The connectors shown are for data connections to SATA drives.
193.    You're building a SAN for your company. Which of the following will you most likely need to install in your server to attach the server to the SAN?

        1. NIC
        2. Modem
        3. Fibre Channel HBA
        4. WAP

        Answer:

        C. A SAN (storage area network) is a separate network that has only storage devices on it, but you still need a way to connect to that storage. Connecting can be done through a host bus adapter (HBA) connected through the PCIe bus on a network server's motherboard. Since Fibre Channel (FC) networks are so fast, they are often used for SANs.
194.    Your friend is looking over your shoulder as you work on a computer. They ask what all the pins sticking up are. Some are labeled USB1, some USB2, and others are labeled front panel. What is the generic term for these pins on the motherboard?

        1. Ports
        2. Pins
        3. Standoffs
        4. Headers

        Answer:

        D. These pins are called headers. The ones mentioned connect the motherboard to the case front, where you will find USB ports, power buttons, HDD status lights, and reset switches.

        1. PCIe
        2. ATX motherboard power
        3. ATX12V motherboard power
        4. RAID drive

        Answer:

        C. The image shown is a 24 pin ATX12V motherboard power connector. Original ATX motherboard power connectors were 20 pin. The color doesn't matter, but the number and shape of pins does. Technically this is a type of Molex connector, but it is commonly called P1. In addition, motherboards may use a 4-pin, 12V connector or an 8-pin power connector to supply additional power for the CPU.
196.    What type of CPU is considered long obsolete?

        1. Single-core
        2. Multicore
        3. ARM
        4. Intel

        Answer:

        A. All modern CPUs are multicore processors, meaning they have more than one processor on a die and can execute at least four threads at a time. ARM is a processor architecture used in many devices, and Intel is a processor manufacturer.
197.    You need a PC solution that is capable of accepting video footage from a gaming console or video camera and saving it in a file. You also want to ensure that it won't skip, lag, or freeze. Which of the following would be the best solution?

        1. Webcam
        2. FireWire card
        3. Capture card
        4. Screen-capture software

        Answer:

        C. A webcam would be very inefficient and difficult solution at best, and FireWire would not be fast enough for today's systems. While screen-capture software might work, the best solution would be to install a capture card either as a discrete (external) unit or in a PCIe slot on a motherboard. The capture card can take some of the workload off the processor, making the video less likely to skip, lag, or freeze.
198.    A business has a PC that a user needs to work with in a room that is not air-conditioned, but the computer keeps shutting down because the processor is overheating. You've checked the cooler and thermal paste and it's fine. What can you do in this PC to help it run cool enough?

        1. Add case fans.
        2. Add heat monitoring software.
        3. Remove the chassis cover.
        4. Set it inside a refrigerator.

        Answer:

        A. Adding case fans can draw excess heat out of a case, and cooler air into the case. Most processors won't shut down until they reach 70 to 100 degrees Celsius (158 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit), so if a person is working in that room, the ambient temperature won't be that high. Heat monitoring software lets you see what's going on but won't help cool the case. Removing the chassis cover subjects the computer to debris and dust that can cause other problems, and a refrigerator is likely to cause condensation, which can short out electrical systems. Adding case fans is the best choice given. Using a water-cooled system or adding a bigger heat sink to the processor might also help.
199.    You are replacing the power supply in a computer system that uses a 24-pin P1 connector. You have a few power supplies in the closet to choose from. Which one with the following connections will work? (Choose two.)

        1. 20-pin P1 connector and P4 connector
        2. 20-pin+4-pin P1 connector
        3. An ATX12V PSU
        4. An ATX12VO power supply

        Answer:

        B, C. Some power supplies will have a 20-pin+4-pin connector designed to connect to a 24-pin P1 motherboard connector. An ATX12V PSU is the perfect solution. A 20-pin P1 connector plus a P4 connector is the right number of pins, but the P4 connector is not compatible with the main motherboard power. ATX12VO is a 12 volt only connector that has only 10 pins and that would not be compatible with this motherboard, unless it had other connections.
200.    You're considering a power supply that has interchangeable cables that plug into and out of the power supply so that you can have exactly the connectors you need and not have extra cables taking up space in the case. What type of power supply is this?

        1. ATX
        2. ATX12V
        3. Molex
        4. Modular

        Answer:

        D. A modular power supply allows you to use only the connectors you need by plugging and unplugging compatible cables into the PSU.
201.    You're setting up a server that can't possibly have downtime. Which of the items below do you need to make sure you have connected to it?

        1. HBA
        2. Redundant power supply
        3. Display
        4. Dual rail power supply

        Answer:

        B. If you have a system that can't have any downtime, then you need to have redundant everything. An HBA is a host bus adapter, which you only need if connecting external devices. A display doesn't have anything to do with redundancy. A dual rail power supply can still fail. For this situation you would want redundant power supplies that are hot-swappable.
202.    Your new tech is unboxing a new printer and you see them open the top and flip the box upside-down, then pull the box off the printer. What will you say? (Choose two.)

        1. Great job, that's exactly how I would do it.
        2. That's not the right way to unbox a printer.
        3. It's better to lay the box on its side and pull the materials out.
        4. Please use a box cutter next time to cut the corners from top to bottom.

        Answer:

        B, C. Whenever you get new equipment for the first time, the best choice is to check for manufacturer's directions. Lacking those, flipping a printer over and pulling the box off of the printer may cause damage before you've even set it up! The best course of action is to slide the contents gently out of the box. Using box cutters could damage the printer or its cables.
203.    You just purchased a network-enabled multifunction device. Which one of the following connection types are likely not built into it?

        1. Bluetooth
        2. Wi-Fi
        3. Ethernet
        4. RFID

        Answer:

        D. Most modern network-enabled multifunction devices will have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet connections. They may also have AirPrint support for Apple devices. They are not likely to have RFID as a connection type, although they may have an RFID reader for secure print job authentication.
204.    You have a client that wants to use carbonless, multipart forms with their new printer. What type of printer will you recommend for them?

        1. Laser
        2. Inkjet
        3. Impact
        4. Thermal

        Answer:

        C. The only type of printer that will print on all copies of multipart forms is an impact printer, usually a dot-matrix. It's the only type of printer listed that makes a mark by physically striking the paper. These multipart forms are sometimes called NCR (No Carbon Required) or carbonless multipart forms. The back of each page, except the last one, will have a coating of microencapsulated ink or dye that produces an image when it is pressed or written on.
205.    The administrative assistant at your company needs to be able to choose between printing on letterhead or plain paper for each print job. You're training them how to do this. What settings will you be showing them?

        1. Orientation
        2. Duplexing
        3. Quality
        4. Tray settings

        Answer:

        D. If you have a printer with multiple trays, normally when you print there will be a setting that allows you to choose which tray to print from. Letterhead can be in one tray and plain paper in another. Orientation is whether the paper is printed in the taller or wider direction. Duplexing means printing on both sides, and quality settings let the user choose either faster or better printing.
206.    Which types of printers require calibration as a part of maintenance? (Choose two.)

        1. Laser
        2. Thermal
        3. Impact
        4. Inkjet

        Answer:

        A, D. Both laser and inkjet printers occasionally need to be calibrated. Exactly when depends on the printer, but often for inkjet printers it's after installing a new ink cartridge, and for laser printers, when you need to adjust colors.
207.    What printer feature will store documents on the printer and not print them until the user enters a password or scans an ID card on the print device?

        1. Secured prints
        2. Snap prints
        3. User authentication
        4. Auditing

        Answer:

        A. Secured prints is the feature described. Secure print jobs are retrieved at the device based on user authentication by using either a password or a security badge, depending on the printer. Auditing won't prevent attacks, but it will show you when the printer is being accessed and by whom, much like Event Viewer. Other security features might include removable hard drives with the printer, overwriting documents following DoD (Department of Defense) requirements, and data encryption.
208.    What type of connectivity device is used to terminate network runs in a telecommunications closet?

        1. Punchdown block
        2. Switch
        3. Router
        4. Terminator

        Answer:

        A. A punchdown block can be found in a telecommunications closet mounted on a networking rack. Network drops from work areas are terminated (punched down) in the back, and cables with RJ-45 connectors connect the front to a switch or router. Punchdown blocks provide a neat way to keep cables organized. Switches and routers are network connectivity devices. A terminator is another name for a terminating resistor, which is sometimes needed at the end of a length of coaxial cable.
209.    What two consumable materials are used by 3D printers? (Choose two.)

        1. Resin
        2. Paper
        3. Filament
        4. Extruder nozzle

        Answer:

        A, C. Resin and filament are the consumable materials used by 3D printers to make the 3D objects. The extruder nozzle will often last the life of the printer. There may be a tape or base material that lines the print bed that is also replaced for each new print job so that the print job can be easily removed from the print bed.
210.    What are three communication interfaces that are used by SSDs to send data across a motherboard? (Choose three.)

        1. NVMe
        2. SATA
        3. PCIe
        4. IDE

        Answer:

        A, B, C. Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe), SATA, and PCIe are all communication methods used by solid-state drives to connect to the motherboard for transferring data between the drive and CPU. IDE is a legacy connection technology that was used with the original ATA drives, parallel ATA (PATA).
211.    What is the (approximate) maximum theoretical bandwidth of a PCIe x16 slot, version 5.0?

        1. 500 MBps
        2. 1,000 MBps
        3. 64 GBps
        4. 128 GBps

        Answer:

        C. There are five major versions of PCIe currently specified: 1.x, 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0. For the five versions, a single bidirectional lane operates at a data rate of 250 MBps, 500 MBps, approximately 1 GBps, roughly 2 GBps, and nearly 4 GBps respectively. Each PCIe slot can have up to 16 lanes, the number of lanes being indicated by x1, x4, x8, x16. (The x is pronounced as _by_.) Therefore, a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot can support up to 64 GBps of bandwidth. (16 x 4 = 64).
