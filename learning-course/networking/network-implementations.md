# Network Implementations

### Ethernet Network Switches

* Networking device connecting multiple systems
* Essential network function
* Connects a source device directly to the destination device

#### Layer 2 Switch characteristics

* Use MAC addresses
* Creates the connection between devices

#### Layer 3 Switch characteristics

* Uses IP addresses
* Higher port density
* Faster
* Common in large scale enterprises

#### Layer 2 vs. 3 Functionality

**Layer 2**

* Only switches packets from one port to another
* Does not support routing
* Device communications within same network only

**Layer 3**

* Switches and routes
* Device communications both within and outside network

### Ethernet Network Routers

* Guides and directs data using **network address portion of an IP address**
* Reads data, prioritizes, and selects best route

#### Benefits

* Connect networks
* Security features
* Sharing and access

#### Types of Routers

* Core - are internal
* Edge - for internet
* Distribution
* Wireless - for home or small bussiness
* Virtual

#### Key Router Considerations

* Connectivity
* Bandwidth
* Wireless capability
* Setup and management
* Security
* Flexibilty
* Automatic updates
* QoS (Quality of Service) controls - distinguish different types of traffic and prioritize them
* User configurations and guest networks
* Mesh networks

PoE (Power over Ethernet) - ability to send power over the Ethernet cable

### Ethernet Network Hubs and Bridges

* Interconnection devices
* Implementations

#### Hub Characteristics

Input - Hub receives data frame

Output - Hub retransmits on all outgoing ports

#### Hub types

* Passive
* Active
* Intelligent

#### Hub considerations

* Noisy
* Layer 1 devices
* Extends maximum distance

#### Bridges

* Layer 2 device
* Packet switch
* Examines and forwards

#### Benefits

* Preserve isolated collision domains
* Interconnect various LAN technologies
* Limitless

### Common Networking Devices

* Facilitate communication and interaction between hardware
* Examples include hubs, switches, routers and bridges

#### Access Points

* Data link layer
* WAPs (Wireless Access Point)
* Multiple ports
* Limited by transmission range

#### Load Balancers

* Distribute network load
* Ensure high availability and reliability
* Scalable

#### Proxy servers

* Control Internet usage
* Save bandwidth and improve speed
* Provide privacy
* Improve security
* Provide access to blocked resources

#### Voice Gateways and Repeaters

* VoIP infrastructure
* Connects network with telecommunications provider
* Amplifies signal it receives (if you need to span a distance beyond that you can implement Repeater)
* Physical layer

#### Media Converters

* Convert communication protocols
* Increase cabling distance
* Reduce interference

#### VPN Concentrator

* Centralize multiple incoming VPN connections

### Firewall Security Devices

* Firewall policies define access

#### How Firewalls work

* examine the contents of those packets
* reject or allow based on what the contents are

#### Firewall Options

* Hardware
* Software

#### Firewall types

* Application-layer
* Packet filtering
* Circuit-level
* Proxy server
* Next generation
* Stateful

#### Network Firewall Advantages

* Monitor network traffic
* Stop attacks
* Prevent hacking
* Stop spyware
* Promote privacy

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

* Monitors for malicious activity and policy violations
* Collects and/or reports

#### Classifications

* NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) - physical device that sits at the edge of your network and is designed to protect the entire network
* HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System) - is a software

#### Types

* Signature-based
* Anomaly-based

#### Advantages

* Can be tuned
* Data in context
* Attack analysis
* Compliance
* Increased efficiency&#x20;

#### Disadvantages

* False alarms
* Source addresses
* Encrypted packets
* Analytic limitations

### Common Network Service Devices

* Equipment that connects to a network
* Enhanced network functionality

Examples:

* Networked Security Camera
* Printers
* Networked Physical Access Control
  * Doors
* Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) Sensors

### Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

* Voice-based calls using an IP network

#### How VoIP Works

* Convert - electrical waves generated by phone converted into digital information
* Compress - to reduce amount of traffic on the network
* VoIP Provider - establish a connection with a VoIP provider
* Establish call
* Decompress

#### VoIP User Configuration

* Desk phone
* SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) server

#### VoIP Benefits

* Reliable
* Cost-effective
* Flexible
* Enhanced features - custom voicemail messages, video capability, e-mail system
* Reduced infrastructure
