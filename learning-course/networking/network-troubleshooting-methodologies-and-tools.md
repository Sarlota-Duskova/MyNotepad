## Network Cabling Considerations



## Network Cabling Applications

* IEEE
* Code 802.3
* Open standards

### Common Network Cables

* Straight-through
* Crossover
* Rollover

#### Straight-through

* Also called wired patch or ethernet cable
* Connects to same pin at either end
* Used to connect a DTE (Data Terminal Equipment - refert to computer) to a DCA (Data Communications Equipment - refers to switch)

#### Crossover

* Crosses over the wire
* Required if you need to connect two devices of the same type together (direct computer to computer connection or a switch to a switch)
* Follows both EIA-568A and EIA-568B

#### Rollover

* Reverse pin order of each wire
* Used for RS-232 connectors
* Dated

### Power over Ethernet (POE)

* Time to cost savings
* Flexibility
* Safety
* Reliability
* Scalability

## Attenuation, Latency and Jitter



## Troubleshooting Crosstalk and EMI

### Jitter

* Deviation in a signal pulse
* Network congestion
* Timing drift
* Route changes
* Sequence order

### Measuring Crosstalk

* NEXT (Near-End CrossTalk)
* FEXT (Far-End CrossTalk)

#### Crosstalk Symptoms

* Error and noise
* Packet loss

#### Preventing Crosstalk

* Shielded cable
* Physical separation

### Understanding Electromagnetic Interference

* Caused by electromagnetic disturbance
* Can affect overall performance of any type of device or data transmission
* Radio frequency interference

#### Symptoms of EMI

* Direct physical contact
* Too close to electromagnetic field

#### Resolving EMI

* Distance
* Shielded cables
* Filters

## Trobleshooting Opens and Shorts



## Duplex and Transceiver Mismatches

### Auto Negotiation

* Eliminates need to manually configure settings

### Recognizing Duplex Issues

* Late collision error

### Mitigating Duplex Errors

* Configure manually
* Use MAU

## Bad Ports, Bottlenecks, and VLAN Mismatches

### Avoiding VLAN Mismatches

* Configure trunking switches to same native VLAN
* Monitor for problems

## Damaged Cables and Bent Pins



## LED Status Indicators



## Common Cable Tools



## Test
