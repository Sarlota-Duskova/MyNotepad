## Network Cabling Considerations



## Network Cabling Applications

* IEEE
* Code 802.3
* Open standards

### Common Network Cables

* Straight-through
* Crossover
* Rollover

#### Straight-through

* Also called wired patch or ethernet cable
* Connects to same pin at either end
* Used to connect a DTE (Data Terminal Equipment - refert to computer) to a DCA (Data Communications Equipment - refers to switch)

#### Crossover

* Crosses over the wire
* Required if you need to connect two devices of the same type together (direct computer to computer connection or a switch to a switch)
* Follows both EIA-568A and EIA-568B

#### Rollover

* Reverse pin order of each wire
* Used for RS-232 connectors
* Dated

### Power over Ethernet (POE)

* Time to cost savings
* Flexibility
* Safety
* Reliability
* Scalability

## Attenuation, Latency and Jitter



## Troubleshooting Crosstalk and EMI

### Jitter

* Deviation in a signal pulse
* Network congestion
* Timing drift
* Route changes
* Sequence order

### Measuring Crosstalk

* NEXT (Near-End CrossTalk)
* FEXT (Far-End CrossTalk)

#### Crosstalk Symptoms

* Error and noise
* Packet loss

#### Preventing Crosstalk

* Shielded cable
* Physical separation

### Understanding Electromagnetic Interference

* Caused by electromagnetic disturbance
* Can affect overall performance of any type of device or data transmission
* Radio frequency interference

#### Symptoms of EMI

* Direct physical contact
* Too close to electromagnetic field

#### Resolving EMI

* Distance
* Shielded cables
* Filters

## Trobleshooting Opens and Shorts



## Duplex and Transceiver Mismatches

### Auto Negotiation

* Eliminates need to manually configure settings

### Recognizing Duplex Issues

* Late collision error

### Mitigating Duplex Errors

* Configure manually
* Use MAU

## Bad Ports, Bottlenecks, and VLAN Mismatches

### Avoiding VLAN Mismatches

* Configure trunking switches to same native VLAN
* Monitor for problems

## Damaged Cables and Bent Pins

* Complete service disruptions
* Slow or intermittent performance
* On and off connectivity

### Diagnosing Damaged Cables

* Look for visual damage
* Check connectivity
* Check cable function

### Bent Pins

* Improper seat
* Connectivity issues
* Performance issues

## LED Status Indicators

* Network interface cards
* Adapter provides troubleshooting method

## Common Cable Tools



## Test

Which type of network transmission issue may be indicative of a short in your cabling system?

* Collisions

After verifying that system functionality has been restored after implementing your solution, which additional steps should be taken?

* Implement preventative measures to reduce the chance of the problem reoccurring

Which type of network cabling typically needs to be installed when running cables between a suspended ceiling and the permanent ceiling?

* Plenum

Escalation of an issue refers to which approach?

* Reporting a problem to the closest level of support first, then moving up from there

Which type of data transmission issue can be caused by strong sources of power, magnetism, or radio?

* Interference

Which primary mitigation techniques should be implemented to help prevent crosstalk?

* Install the cables farther apart from each other
* Use shielded cable instead of unshielded

Establishing a theory of the most probable cause of an issue should involve which steps?

* Questioning users
* Creating a prioritized list of causes

When a network adapter is connected and communicating normally, what would you most likely see from the LED status light indicator?

* Solid green light that flashes rapidly and randomly

Which system configuration settings and/or properties can help to reduce bottlenecks on your network?

* Use auto-negotiate on adapters
* Ensure adequate processing and memory

Identifying the potential impact of a plan of action refers to which possibility upon implementation?

* That the plan may have unforeseen repercussions

Damaged or bent pins will most likely result in which types of network communication issues?

* Intermittent connectivity
* Loss of service

Documentation of the history of a problem should include which items?

* The outcome
* The corrective actions taken
* The symptoms that were exhibited

Which statements correctly characterize the differences between throughput and bandwidth?

* Bandwidth is the measure of how much data can theoretically be transferred
* The measure of bandwidth does not change without changing your equipment
* Throughput is the measure of how much data is actually being transferred

Place the following testing steps in the correct sequence:

* Test
* Confirm
* Look for other cause
* Establish new theory
* Escalate

Which type of cabling should be used when connecting a computer to a switch?

* Straight-through

If the network adapter of a specific computer is set to half duplex to support a legacy application, which settings would be acceptable on the other system with which is it communicating?

* Auto negotiate
* Half duplex

Which testing tool can help you to identify where a wall port connection terminates at the patch panel end?

* Tone generator

Implementing a troubleshooting methodology should begin with which step?

* Identifying the problem
