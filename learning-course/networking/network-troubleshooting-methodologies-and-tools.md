## Network Cabling Considerations



## Network Cabling Applications

* IEEE
* Code 802.3
* Open standards

### Common Network Cables

* Straight-through
* Crossover
* Rollover

#### Straight-through

* Also called wired patch or ethernet cable
* Connects to same pin at either end
* Used to connect a DTE (Data Terminal Equipment - refert to computer) to a DCA (Data Communications Equipment - refers to switch)

#### Crossover

* Crosses over the wire
* Required if you need to connect two devices of the same type together (direct computer to computer connection or a switch to a switch)
* Follows both EIA-568A and EIA-568B

#### Rollover

* Reverse pin order of each wire
* Used for RS-232 connectors
* Dated

### Power over Ethernet (POE)

* Time to cost savings
* Flexibility
* Safety
* Reliability
* Scalability
