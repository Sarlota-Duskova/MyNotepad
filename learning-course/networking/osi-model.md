# OSI Model

### OSI Layer 1 - Physical



### OSI Layer 2 - Data Link

#### Responsibilities

* Physical addressing
* Framing
* Access control
* Flow control
* Error control

#### Logical Link Control (LLC)

* Media access methods
* Connectionless
* Network layer protocols
* Connection-oriented

#### Medium Access Control (MAC)

* MAC address:
  * 12-character hexadecimal value
  * Unique to every network interface

### OSI Layer 3 - Network

#### Functions

* Packet addressing
* Address conversion
* Source-to-destination delivery
* Routing

#### Routing

* Pass data from router to router among the connected networks
* Determine the best path from source to destination
* Independent networks connected to each other

#### Internetworking

* Provides logical connections between different types of networks
* Combine various networks to form a larger network

#### Logical Addressing

* Define addressing scheme
* Combine any number of network

#### Packetizing

* Creates packets upon receiving data from upper layers
* Packets are created by way of encapsulation
* Internet Protocol (IP) applies addresses to each packet

#### Fragmentation

* Dividing larger packets into smaller fragments
  * Fragments can then be easily sent out on physical medium

### OSI Layer 4 - Transport



### OSI Layer 5 - Session



### OSI Layer 6 - Presentation



### OSI Layer 7 - Application
