* Dissaster recovery
* Accessibility

#### Cloud Storage Considerations

* Speed
* Control

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Infrastructure management
* DevOps versioning
* Identical environment every time
* Continuous delivery

#### IaC Features

* Idempotence - when environment that is created needs to be identical to a previous implementation, there can't be any changes or drift from the original
* Identical configuration - each iteration of the code results in an identical configuration every time
* Automatic or manual
* Teams makes changes
* Configure targets
* Source, not target, edited

#### IaC Implementation

* Early testing
* Avoid deployment problems

#### Advantages

* Stable environments
* Rapid
* Less manual configuration
* Consistency
* Repeatable
* Avoid runtime problems
* Consistent procedures and tools

### Multi-tenant Cloud

* For public cloud provider there are multiple customers that are all using or sharing the same physical resources and infrastructure
* Transparent
* IaaS, SaaS, PaaS

#### Advantages

* More efficient resource usage
* Lower costs

#### Disadvantages

* Security
* Compliance
* Performance

### Elastic Computing

* Resource allocation

* Automatic
* Just what's needed

#### Features

* Application needs resources

#### Provisioning

* Over and under-provisioning
* Too much or not enough
* Paying too much
