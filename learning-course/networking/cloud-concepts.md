* Scale up and down
* Pay per use
* For developing and testing
  * Storage and backup
  * Host websites
  * High performance computing
  * Web apps

#### Advantages

* Cost savings
* Scalability
* High availability

#### Disadvantages

* Maintenance
* Security
* Legal considerations

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

* Developing web-based applications and services
* Full development environment

#### Features

* Buy only what you need
* Develop and deploy
* Infrastructure
* Tools
* Application lifecycle
* Self-managed
* Reduced complexity

#### Advantages

* Testing and deployment
* Dynamic allocation
* Improved support
* Minimal management

#### Disadvantages

* Lack of control
* Shared platform
* Data security

### Desktop as a Service (DaaS)

* Implement OS in VM
* Cloud infrastructure
* Streamed desktop on any device

#### Features

* Subscription model
* Multi-user
* Provider managed
* Self-managed images
* Cloud-stored data
* Location independent

#### Advantages

* Users choose devices
* Global access
* Highly scalable
* Lower cost

#### Disadvantages

* Internet dependent
* Higher OS license costs

### Common Cloud Connectivity Methods

* Browser-based access

#### VPN Connectivity

* Simpler option
* Appliances or software
* Self-manage resources

#### Direct Connection

* Co-location facilities
* Customer rents facilities

#### Direct Connection Costs

* Data center charges for cross-connect
* Cloud provider charges
* Variable terms

### Cloud Risk Factors

#### IaaS Risk Factors

* Legal considerations
* Failure
* Backup and security
* The network and physical security
* Data disposal

#### PaaS Risk Factors

* Application mapping
* Architecture vulnerabilities
* Application disposal

#### SaaS Risk Factors

* Data location - where data is stored
* Data disposal - data can be saved somewhere else
* Migration or upgrades
* Identity and access management
* Broad exposure
* Browser vulnerabilities
* Exit strategy

#### Public Cloud Risk Factors

* Data pooling
* Collateral damage

#### Private Cloud Risk Factors

* Application compatibility
* Maintenance and training

#### Hybrid Cloud Risks

* Mixing types
* Availability, loss, theft, disclosure

#### Community Cloud Risk Factors

* Differing security measures
* Faulty procedures or SLAs

### Local vs. Cloud Solutions

#### Local Storage

* Speed
* Security
* Control

#### Local Storage Considerations

* Cost
* On-site disasters

#### Cloud Storage

* Cost-effective
* Minimal maintenance
* Scalability
* Dissaster recovery
* Accessibility

#### Cloud Storage Considerations

* Speed
* Control

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Infrastructure management
* DevOps versioning
* Identical environment every time
* Continuous delivery

#### IaC Features

* Idempotence - when environment that is created needs to be identical to a previous implementation, there can't be any changes or drift from the original
* Identical configuration - each iteration of the code results in an identical configuration every time
* Automatic or manual
* Teams makes changes
* Configure targets
* Source, not target, edited

#### IaC Implementation

* Early testing
* Avoid deployment problems

#### Advantages

* Stable environments
* Rapid
* Less manual configuration
* Consistency
* Repeatable
* Avoid runtime problems
* Consistent procedures and tools

### Multi-tenant Cloud

* For public cloud provider there are multiple customers that are all using or sharing the same physical resources and infrastructure
* Transparent
* IaaS, SaaS, PaaS

#### Advantages

* More efficient resource usage
* Lower costs

#### Disadvantages

* Security
* Compliance
* Performance

### Elastic Computing

* Resource allocation
* Determined by need
* Automatic
* Just what's needed

#### Features

* Application needs resources
* Resources provided
* Ass needs change resources allocated

#### Provisioning

* Over and under-provisioning
* Too much or not enough
* Paying too much
* Lacking resources
* Elasticity detects changes in needs

#### Benefits

* Cost efficient
* Optimized resources

### Scalability in Cloud Computing

* Change size or processing power
* Add and remove resources
* Auto-scaling
* Based on need

#### Features

* Grow and shrink
* Significant changes
* Avoid disruption
* Usually fast
* Simplified

#### Scalability and Virtualization

* Easy to reallocate
* Clustering

#### Advantages

* Empowering
* Efficient workflows
* Enables disaster recovery
* Flexibility
* Easier than migrating
* Cost savings

### Cloud Security Concerns and Mitigations

#### Cloud Security Implications

* Lost revenue
* Lost data
* Reputation
* Malicious attacks
* Theft or loss
* Regulations and compliance
* End users - are fully aware of the overall infrastructure and the changes that have taken place
* Shared vulnerability
* Contractual violations
* Vulnerable APIs
* Availability

#### Cloud Security Mitigation

* Manage identities
* Security assessments
* Privacy policies
* Auditing
* Assess infrastructure
* Enforce governance
