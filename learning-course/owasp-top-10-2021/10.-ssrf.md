# 10. SSRF

## SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

* Malicious URL - not properly validated and sanitized by the web server
* HTTP redirection - enabled and not required for the web app
* Lack of authentication
* Lack of PKI certificate check

### SSRF Exploit actions

* Disclosure of sensitive server data
* Instructing server to perform HTTP POST operations to internal services
* Instructing server to perform queries on internal databases

### SSRF Example

1. Attacker submits malicious URL to web server
2. App traffic is allowed through firewall to the web server
3. Server accepts URL without validation
4. Server fetches resource based on malicious URL

## CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)

Web browser has been authenticated to an online banking session and the attacker has somehow compromised the victim's machine or has otherwise tricked them into clicking something that gives the attacker access to things like web browser cookies for that user authenticated session.
