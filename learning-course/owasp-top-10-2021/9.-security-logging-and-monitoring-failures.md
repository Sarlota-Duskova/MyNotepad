# 9. Security logging & Monitoring failures

### Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)

* Facilitates keeping up-to-date with ever-changing cybersecurity threats
* Automated:
  * Compare host/device/network security configuration against baselines
  * Security policy compliance/violation
  * Vulnerability management
* Components:
  * SCAP content modules - NIST and other party acceptable security configurations (Federal Desktop Core Configuration) FDCC

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

* Ingested activity from multiple sources
* Event analysis
* Evenet correlation
* Real-time security alerts

### Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR)

* Automated incident response works with SIEM
* Automation via playbooks

### Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

* Host-based (file integrity monitoring, app/user behavior analytics)
* Network-based (sensors, network traffic analysis, wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS))
* Detect, log, alert, norify

### Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

* Same capabilities as HIDS and NIDS
* Take steps to block attacks
* Block IPs, DNS domain names, blackhole routing

### Test

Which file format is normally used for Wireshark packet captures?

* CAP

What is the purpose of the Snort IDS?

* Detect and report on potential security incidents

Where are Snort IDS rule files located by default?

* /etc/snort/rules

Your station is plugged into switch port 3. You run Wireshark to capture network traffic but can see only your stationâ€™s unicast traffic as well as multicast and broadcast traffic. You must capture all unicast traffic on the switch. What should you do?

* Enable SPAN port monitoring

Which enterprise security solution can automate incident response?

* SOAR

You need to run the Snort IDS on your Linux host with output being shown on the screen. Which command should you issue?

* sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Your web app is hosted in the Microsoft Azure public cloud. You need detailed web app performance metrics. What should you enable?

* Application insights

On which port does the Linux syslog-ng daemon listen on by default?

* 514
