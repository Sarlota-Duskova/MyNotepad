# 2. Cryptographic Failures

* A lack of cryptographic use (no encryption, no integrity)
* Weak cryptographic solution selection such as WEP or WPA for Wi-Fi
* Insufficient security controls protecting secret of private keys

### Hashing - Integrity

Hashing provides integrity where encryption provides confidentiality.

* Ensures data integrity for messages sent over a network
* Provides a secure method of storing passwords
* Detects file system modifications
* Can be used with encryption for confidentiality, integrity, and message authentication
* Is not reversible like encryption is

### Hashing - PowerShell

* Data is fedinto a hashing algorithm
* A key is not used
* The output is a unique fixed-length representation of the input data, such as a 32-bit hash value
  * Hash
  * Message digest
* Modified data results in a different hash value
* File integrity monitoring (FIM)

### Cryptography and Storage

* Self-encrypting drive (SED)
* Windows Encrypting File System (EFS)
  * Requires an NTFS file system, correct Windows edition
  * Encrypt individual files and folders
  * Encrypted files are tied to the user account
* Microsoft BitLocker
  * Encrypts entire fixed or removable disk volumes
  * Can require a startup PIN to decrypt disk volume
  * Can use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip
    * TPM is a firmware chip that is used to store cryptographic keys in a machine.
* Cloud storage encryption, third-party encryption solutions

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

* Hierarchy of digital security certificates (chain of trustt)
* Certificates are issued by a certification authority (CA)
* Public trusted CAs, private internal untrusted CAs

#### PKI Certificate Issuance

A CA can issue PKI certificates to:

* **Individual users** porposes of encrypting files or sending encrypted email messages.
* **Devices** such as to allow authentication to a VPN or to allow an HTTPS binding fo a web server.
* **Software (service principal, managed identity)** to allow them perhaps to authenticate to other components that they might need to talk to.



* Wildcard certificates (\*.mydomain.com) - it will work for www.mydomain.com, sales.mydomain.com not needed separate certificates for each of those entities
* Extended domain validation (enhanced CA due diligence against certificate requester)
* Code signing certificates

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

#### ### Non-technology PII Examples

* Mother's maiden name
* Home street address
* Credit card number

#### Technology-related PII Examples

* IP Address
* Web browser cookie
* Electronic medical record (EMR)

#### PII/ PHI Security Control Periodic Audits

* Review related organizational security policies
* Evaluate security control efficacy
* Identify security control inadequacies
* Implement security control changes

### Data Privacy Standards

* Organizational security policies
* Regulatory/legal compliance

#### Sensitive Information Types

* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Electronic health record (EHR)
* Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
* Personal Health Record (PHR)

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

* International
* Each type of card's security recommendations differ slightly (Visa, Mastercard)
* Provides a roadmap for merchant security standards for protecting cardholder data

#### PCI DSS Security Requirements

### Test

You have created a Microsoft Azure storage account with default settings. What is the encryption state of the storage account?

* Encryption is enabled with Microsoft managed keys

You are editing Group Policy and would like to enable IPsec for affected machines. Which Windows Defender item should you configure?

* Connection security rules
