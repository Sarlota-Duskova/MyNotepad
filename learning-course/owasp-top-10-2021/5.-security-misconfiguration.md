# 5. Security Misconfiguration

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

This is a policy mechanism where we can help protect a web application by enabling secure communications to it.

1. Web app requires a valid public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate
2. Server informs clients via response header that HTTPS is required
3. Forces HTTP to HTTPS redirect via HTTP 301: Permanent redirect

### Application Containers

* Logical app isolation boundary
* Entire app or a single app component

**Include:**

* Running containers are based on containers images
* Images contain software and settings for running a container
* A container is a runtime instance of an image

**Contents:**

* Scripts, binaries, container filesystem
* App-specific libraries, components
* Runtime environment (Linux, Python, web server)
* Configuration files, software tools

**Benefits:**

* App portability across container hosts - they're pretty small because they don't contain an entire file system for an operating system
* Quick app startup time compared to virtual machines (VMs)
* Code changes, updates, and testing done per container

#### Microservices

* Specific app functionality
* Single microservice could be one app container
* Allows for app component decoupling
