# 4. Insecure Design

### The CIA Security Triad

* Confidentiality
  * Contractual, regulatory requirements
  * Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data
  * Storage and network encryption
* Integrity
* Availability

#### Confidentiality - Web Application

* Encrypt data at rest (cloud, on-premises)
* Assign only required permissions for resource access (principal of least privilege)
* Use roles or claims to control restricted app access
* Use HTTPS instead of HTTP (block HTTP)
* Apply patches to OS and web server stack

#### Integrity

* Assurance of the trustworthiness of data
* Can detect data tampering
* Network integrity - digital signatures
* File/database integrity - hash value comparisons
* Audit system and data access where appropriate

#### Availability

* Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
* IT service availability
* Data availability

### Web Application Availability - Load Balancing

With load balancer clients would connect for example to a DNS name such as quick24x7.com that would resolve to the public IP address of the load balancer. The load balancer might be a physical appliance, it might be a virtual appliance, it might be in the cloud, it might be on-prem, many variations. The DNS name resolves to the interface that the load balancer is listening on and the load balancer then routes that client app request to a back-end server that is available and not busy. Even might have enabled autoscaling so that as we get more and more client requests in a short period of time, which means the app is getting busier we might add more back-end VMs dynamically as needed -> **Scaling out**

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

* System design specs
* Develop and implement
* Documentation
* Evaluation and testing
* Transition to production

### SecDevOps (Security, Development and Operations)

**DevOps combines:**

* Software development
* Software operation
* Software maintenance

**Application Programming Interface (API) creation and/or consumption**

### Secure Coding Considerations

* Error messages
* Session timeouts
* Data type and length
* Input validation
* Input sanitization

Do:

* Generate unique session identifiers
* Keep session identifier hidden
* Forbid concurrent user account logins with same account
* Configure the "secure" cookie attribute
* Set the cookie "HTTPOnly" flag
* Principle of least privilege for specific app pages
* Audit app access

### Web Application Sandbox Testing

* Safe testing environment
  * Configuration changes
  * Malware analysis
  * Code changes
* Isolated network
* Virtual machines
* Application containers
* Web application deployment slots

### Fuzz Testing (Fuzzing)

* Blast web app with unanticipated and randomized data
* Observe results and make necessary changes to app, web application firewall (WAF)

### OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

* Free tool
* Web app proxying
* Web app vulnerability scanning
* Web app fuzzing
